4001,"Out of the three candidates nominated, I am the only one who has actually won an election and in a former SPD-stronghold nonetheless, in a strong black-yellow coalition. It is crucial that we win the Bundestagswahl this fall, and I am the right man to do it!",,0,,

4007,"While I will praise Merkel for her outstanding career, we need to acknowledge the challenges of the 21st century: particularly climate change. It is important that we don’t leave this topic to other parties, but present solutions of our own, that go beyond what we are doing now.",,0,,

4023,"It wasn’t an easy decision. I thought about this long and hard, but I want to retract my candidacy. Söder is a competent man, has better polling numbers, many of our party members support him and I’m quite happy here serving as Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia.",,0,,
4024,"Let’s call every big name in the party, curry every favour, maybe we can even get Merkel herself to weigh in. I can’t have this decided by vote and risk being humiliated, I want this decided by the party elites now.",-1,0,,
4025,The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.,,0,,

4028,"This closer-than-expected contest has convinced me that I need to move my position and change my attitude on some topics.

4029,"I will give a largely non-political speech. We need to focus on the importance of cohesion and trust in our society, to come together as one in the wake of this crisis, not letting our different views divide us, and the values of honest work.

4032,"I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to take the climate more seriously. Let’s unveil some of our own environmental policies to stop their momentum and defuse some of their criticisms.",,0,1,
4033,"Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for centre-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and just attack them moderately where we can.",,0,,
