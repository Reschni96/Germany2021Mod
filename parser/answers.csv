4000,"I will offer my congratulations to Armin Laschet, for winning the leadership competition. Together, we will keep writing the success story of the CDU/CSU. I’m looking forward to a close cooperation.",-1,-1,,
4001,"Publicly, I of course want to congratulate him for winning the leadership election, to not rock any boats in the partnership of our parties. However, I’m worried that a guy like him will lose us the election in the fall. Behind the scenes, I will prepare my strike for what really counts: the chancellor candidacy.",2,,,
4002,"Of course I will congratulate him. However, I want to make it clear that him being party leader does not automatically make him chancellor candidate. I’ll make some remarks that we will have to sort this question out later.",3,1,,
4003,"First, I want to congratulate him publicly. At the same time, let’s reach out to some of the people who supported his opponents in the leadership election and start convincing them that I am the better chancellor candidate. I know that <span class='mytooltip'>Norbert Röttgen<span class='mytooltiptext'>Once a prominent CDU politician and Minister of the Environment (2009-2012): humiliatingly fired after his defeat as the CDU candidate for the North Rhine-Westphalian elections. In 2020 he tried for a comeback, but ended up as a third wheel behind Laschet and Merz.</span></span> made some veiled overtures to me..",1,,,
4004,"I’m already quite well known among the German people, but it’s time to give my profile a boost, so that people think of me instead of him when talking about Christian Democracy. Let’s go to every talk show that wants to have me and make sure people see my face constantly.",-1,,,
4005,"My polling is better than Laschets, but the chancellor candidacy isn’t a popularity contest: it’s about connections. I will speak with as many CDU functionaries as I can in the coming weeks, to start getting them on my side. I know our youth organization <span class='mytooltip'>JU<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Junge Union”, “Young Union”. The youth organization of the CDU/CSU. Usually considered quite unadventurous.</span></span> is quite receptive to me.",1,,,
4006,"I’m already the darling of our party base. The CDU leadership will have to acknowledge this, and pick me over Laschet. Right now, I want to start focusing on the general election and attack the SPD and the Greens whenever an opportunity presents itself. As someone not intricately involved in Merkel's administration, I‘m able to make a good attack dog.",-2,,,
4007,"It would probably backfire if I were to personally attack the CDU, so I will do nothing of the sort. However, I’m sure there are plenty of CSU politicians who can find things to be critical of. I will talk to my party behind the scenes to lead the push against Laschet as the Unions candidate.",2,1,,1
4008,"I’ve been known as a lockdown hardliner in the past. However, it’s clear people are starting to grumble - the situation in Bavaria is quite good compared to other states, so we should be able to loosen up our measures and open up fairly quickly. We’re a Free State, not a Constraint State.",1,,,
4009,"The situation is still very volatile, so I will keep doing what I’ve been doing for the whole pandemic so far and stay on a hard line against Covid. There will be no premature openings in Bavaria.",-1,,,1
4010,"Throughout the pandemic, people have looked to me for leadership even outside of Bavaria and I have to maintain my outsized role in this discourse. I will call for whatever seems more popular at the moment: Bavaria as the land of Caution, Bavaria as the land of Proportionality, Bavaria as the land of Freedom… any way the wind blows.",2,,,1
4011,"I support Armin Laschet's proposal of a <span class='mytooltip'>bridge lockdown<span class='mytooltiptext'>Proposal by Armin Laschet. The goal is to generally open up, but to have a short term, harsh lockdown in April, to bridge the time until more people are vaccinated and more tests are available.</span></span> over Easter, until enough people are vaccinated. I’ve always been in support of measures like this, and so has the chancellor.",-2,-1,,
4012,"Under no circumstances will we raise taxes, but we don’t want to dramatically lower them either. We will phase out the extra tax of the <span class='mytooltip'>Soli<span class='mytooltiptext'>Solidaritätszuschlag. An extra tax levelled since 1995 to help East Germany in its post-reunification development.</span></span> and try to reduce the burden on small and medium-income earners while always keeping the budget balanced, in keeping with the “<span class='mytooltip'>Black Zero<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Schwarze Null” in German; economic principle that forbids new debts while promising a balanced budget.</span></span>”.",,,,
4013,"The Covid crisis has left a massive hole in our budget that we have to plug somehow. We have to be measured, but a tax increase will likely be unavoidable to avoid harsh debts that can hurt our economy even further.",-1,,,
4014,"Taxes for private households should stay where they are or even be lowered by phasing out the <span class='mytooltip'>Soli<span class='mytooltiptext'>Solidaritätszuschlag. An extra tax levelled since 1995 to help East Germany in its post-reunification development.</span></span>. More importantly, corporate taxes should be lowered to unleash the full economic potential of this country. As little State as necessary, as much market as possible.",,,,
4015,"The most important thing we can do now is lower the taxes for small and medium-income earners, our tax policy is failing them. Besides that, I’ll mainly attack the tax plans of the other parties.",2,,,
4016,"I’m as shocked and outraged as everyone else when this came to light. There will be new rules for members of my party that they have to make all earnings public, to prevent something like this from happening again.",,,,
4017,"Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened. Luckily, it seems like the CDU is in more trouble than the CSU, so maybe I can use this to paint me as a more competent party leader.",2,,,1
4018,This is nothing but a political hit job by a left-wing magazine in an election year. I’m sure further investigations will prove the innocence of these MPs.,1,,,
4019,"We have to deflect from this as much as possible. I will make it clear that I have zero tolerance for corruption, but I will refrain from any incendiary statements. I don’t want to get associated with this personally.",,,,
4020,"I have to be careful here, I don’t want to come across as too power-hungry. First, I will call Laschet and tell him that I think a challenge would be best for the party, and then tentatively acknowledge my ambitions to the media.",-2,-1,,
4021,"It’s an open secret my true goal is the chancellor candidacy. Let’s not beat around the bush -  let’s make an announcement as soon as possible to catch Laschet by surprise. If he has to catch up, we can paint him in an even worse light.",1,1,,
4022,"Doing this the wrong way could backfire - my appeal lies in my popularity, so let’s work through that. I’ll have my supporters in the CDU and CSU demand that I save the party from Laschet's bad polling numbers, and then - “reluctantly” - declare my candidacy.",2,,,1
4023,"Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.",-1,,,
4024,"During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.",1,1,,
4025,"The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.",,,,
4026,"The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.",,,,
4027,"First and foremost, I want to thank Armin Laschet for this fair competition. I want to plead for a united Union, to continue our successful governance of Germany. Apart from that, I will hit my usual talking points.",-1,,,
4028,"If you want to look at how I want to govern this country, look at Bavaria. We are one of the most successful states by a big number of metrics and my popularity there speaks for itself. As an accomplished leader of the Free State, Germany will shine just as bright.",,,,2
4029,"It’s clear that the two most important topics this election are Covid and climate change. I will guide Germany through the pandemic like I guided Bavaria, and I will make sure our transition to renewable energies goes along smoothly. I will continue to lead Germany into the modern age and pull us through the challenges we’re facing.",,,,1
4030,"Merkel has been a respected leader for these last 16 years, and I will do my best to follow in her path and continue her successful stewardship of our beloved country.",1,,2,
4031,"The Green party is always surging a few months before elections and comes crashing down in time, just like in 2011 after <span class='mytooltip'>Fukushima<span class='mytooltiptext'>In 2011, a disaster took place at the nuclear reactor in Fukushima, Japan. Resulted in the first Green surge, and Merkel changing course on Nuclear Energy; resuming the phase-out that started under the preceding Red-Green coalition.</span></span>. I’m not too worried - we should still focus more on competing with the SPD, our traditional opponent.",2,,,
4032,"I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to act on climate change. Let’s unveil some of our own sensible and realistic environmental policies, piece by piece, to catch media attention away from them and stop their momentum.",1,,,
4033,"Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for center-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and just attack them moderately where we can.",,,,
4034,"Actually, this is a bit ridiculous and reminds me of the publicity stunt the FDP pulled in 2002 when they nominated <span class='mytooltip'>Guido Westerwelle<span class='mytooltiptext'>FDP party chair (2001-2011) and later Foreign Minister (2009-2013). Was named as  “chancellor candidate” by the FDP in 2002, in a bid to win 18%, but only got 7.4. One of the first German politicians to come out as gay, he sadly died in 2016 from leukemia.</span></span> as chancellor candidate. Let’s mock them for their hubris and don’t refer to Habeck as a legitimate chancellor candidate.",-1,,,
4035,"It is important that we don’t demonize Putin and keep our dialogue open. I’m critical of many things the Russian leadership has done, but overall, we should strive to cooperate with them, as we do on the <span class='mytooltip'>Nord-Stream 2<span class='mytooltiptext'>Planned natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, through the Baltic Sea.</span></span> pipeline.",,,,
4036,"I’ve been more lenient in the past, but enough is enough. I will join in with the criticism against <span class='mytooltip'>Kretschmer<span class='mytooltiptext'>Michael Kretschmer, Minister-President of Saxony (Since 2017). Traveled to Moscow, and at several points demanded the sanctions against Russia be lifted. Was also somewhat of a soft Covid-skeptic in 2020, but changed course later on.</span></span> and call for a tougher stance towards Putin. Maybe we should only open the <span class='mytooltip'>Nord-Stream 2<span class='mytooltiptext'>Planned natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, through the Baltic Sea.</span></span> pipeline if we get some concessions from Russia.",2,,,

Traveled to Moscow, and at several points demanded the sanctions against Russia be lifted.

I’m all in favor of more dialogue and stronger economic ties with Russia. Putin is reasonable and can be talked to, as I did last year!",-1,,,
4038,"This whole thing is overblown, this trip was mostly for cultural exchange. I don’t have much to say about this. We stand on our commitment to Nato.",1,,,
4501,"In hindsight, Merkel’s decision seems right to me, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the <span class='mytooltip'>EU<span class='mytooltiptext'>European Union; supranational political entity, serving as a political and economic union between 27 European countries, including free trade, open borders, political cooperation and a common legislative body.

4502,"There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.",1,,,
4503,"Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We’re saying: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.",3,,1,
4504,"On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the <span class='mytooltip'>EU<span class='mytooltiptext'>European Union; supranational political entity, serving as a political and economic union between 27 European countries, including free trade, open borders, political cooperation and a common legislative body.

A great amount had been held up in Hungary, until Merkel unilaterally decided to let them come to Germany. About 400k Syrians fled to Germany during this time.</span></span> can’t repeat itself.",-2,,,
4039,"This was a bad decision by the court. The <span class='mytooltip'>Climate Protection Act<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Klimaschutzgesetz” in German. Originally enacted by the Grand Coalition in 2019, it promises to uphold the goals by the Paris Conference and lays down concrete goals for CO²-emissions until 2030.</span></span> already went far enough and I’m not in favor of hurting the economy with a stricter climate policy. We need to look out for our personal and economic freedoms, fear is not the answer.",3,,,
4040,"I’ve always been an advocate for doing more against climate change. While this has not been mandated by the court, we will also rework our regional <span class='mytooltip'>Climate Protection Act<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Klimaschutzgesetz” in German. Originally enacted by the Grand Coalition in 2019, it promises to uphold the goals by the Paris Conference and lays down concrete goals for CO²-emissions until 2030.</span></span> in Bavaria, to make sure we are doing enough.",-1,,,
4041,"We have to become carbon neutral long before 2050. I’m sure the government under Merkel will come up with a sensible solution, which I will continue as chancellor.",,,,
4042,"With the decision by the court, we now have the great opportunity to have an ambitious new <span class='mytooltip'>Climate Protection Act<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Klimaschutzgesetz” in German. Originally enacted by the Grand Coalition in 2019, it promises to uphold the goals by the Paris Conference and lays down concrete goals for CO²-emissions until 2030.</span></span>. Bavaria is on its way to becoming carbon-neutral by 2040, and the whole country should be put on a similar path.",1,,,
4505,"Yes, I do. Accepting the scientific consensus on climate change and advocating for modern policies is what makes Bavaria so successful - to modernize the whole Union, we have to recalibrate our attitude towards climate action and protecting our social safety net. The CDU/CSU are innovative parties of the 21st century, and I will not let myself get intimidated by right-wing demagogues.",-1,,1,1
4506,"I do not think in ideological categories, I’m simply standing for what I think is good for Germany. The CDU is the party of good governance - not radicalism, both leftist or rightist.",-1,,2,
4507,"I wanted to begin this campaign by bringing us all together - now we can try to tilt the discourse rightwards, taking Merkel supporters with us while framing our conservative positions as more reasonable.",3,,,
4043,"We need to open up quickly for vaccinated people. A return to normalcy has never been so close, and we all had more than enough of lockdowns - not every measure might still be proportionate. Vaccinated people have less risk and thus should receive more benefits.",1,,,
4044,"In Bavaria, we are deciding to be on the safe side, consciously. Of course, freedom will only be possible through vaccinations - but I’m particularly worried about these mutations. Opening up too quickly here can be a dangerous combination. Instead, we need to broadly spend more money to buy more from several vaccine producers.",-2,,,1
4045,"It’s important that as many people as possible get vaccinated as quickly as possible so we can overcome this crisis. We have to think of measures to get more people vaccinated, like organizing mobile vaccination teams in supermarkets and ending the priority system.",,,,
4046,"The vaccine seems helpful now, but we haven’t had a chance to study its side effects yet. We should be mindful of our bodily health and not be too quick in our judgment - I advocate for a slowdown of the vaccination campaign until we have more information.",,,,
4047,"For years and years, we have consistently missed the <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955.

4048,"While I strongly reaffirm our support of a united Alliance and strong defense, I specifically want to call out Robert Habeck. He did not issue a strong endorsement of <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955. Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span> yet, which is not appropriate for a chancellor.",2,,,
4049,"I want to praise the work we’ve done so far and believe we are in a good spot. While I strongly reaffirm my commitment to <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955. Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span>, we don’t need to spend more on defense than we do right now; we need to combat waste first and foremost.",-1,,,

Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span> is a relic of the cold war. We should stay a member for now, but we should also try to find avenues for cooperating with other nations, keep reaffirming our neutrality, and open up new dialogues with Russia or China, as I did with my visit to Moscow last year.",2,,,
4508,"The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.",,,,
4509,"A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a <span class='mytooltip'>Canada-style point-system<span class='mytooltiptext'>In Canada, points are awarded for potential “economic immigrants”, for qualifications, education and experiences, formally indiscriminate of the origin country. Said to be quite successful in attracting qualified workers.</span></span>.",,,,
4510,"It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the <span class='mytooltip'>Riester-system<span class='mytooltiptext'>State-encouraged private pension system named after former Minister of Labour, Walter Riester (SPD, 1998-2002), aimed at low-income workers who may get tax refunds on privately saved up money.</span></span>, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.",1,,,
4511,"We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.",,,,
4051,"I want to congratulate <span class='mytooltip'>Haseloff<span class='mytooltiptext'>Reiner Haseloff, Minister-President of Sachsen-Anhalt (CDU, since 2011). Grew up in East Germany, and joined the CDU- block party in the DDR early on. Generally uncontroversial and respected.</span></span> for his strong performance.

Grew up in East Germany, and joined the CDU- block party in the DDR early on.

When we keep appealing and listening to all people, without prejudice, we can win them back for the democratic parties.",-1,,,
4053,"This was a very strong performance. To show my gratitude, I will make an extra trip to Saxony-Anhalt and campaign with him for some nice pictures.",1,,,
4512,I want to attack the philosopher Habeck on his elitist demeanor. The Greens are led by academics and their policies ignore the concerns of ordinary people. They do not represent the average working-class German!,2,,,
4513,"I want to hit Habeck on remarks he made about me on Twitter - his rants about me are unprofessional, and harmful for our democratic process. Questioning the loyalty to our constitution should be directed at the political extremes, not towards the parties of the democratic center.",1,,,
4514,"While Habeck himself seems to be a clean guy, his co-party leader Annalena Baerbock not only fumbled in her CV and plagiarized in her book, she also reported her earning far too late. A party that is led by such careless personalities should not lead Germany!",3,,,
4515,"Let’s stay on message and campaign in a positive way. This campaign isn’t won with attacks, but by convincing people that I am the best choice for chancellor!",-2,,,
4054,"The pandemic has shown how ill-prepared our schools are. We need to continue improving digital infrastructure in education, through more training, technical assets and a national educational platform. That is what the CDU/CSU has worked on, and will continue doing.",-1,,,1
4055,"Actually, we don’t have much to gain by talking about this topic - many voters see us as responsible for the current situation. Let’s downplay it as much as we can and focus on issues where we are seen as more competent, like matters of security or debt.",1,,,
4056,"We definitely need to modernize the digital infrastructure of Germany, especially in the public sector. Administrative matters have to be more accessible to citizens, we need to digitize all internal processes and cut down on bureaucracy.",,,,
4057,"Digitalization is a key issue - we need a digital transformation offensive. I want to especially emphasize that we will accomplish a nationwide 5G mobile network by 2025 and provide 15 billion Euros for Gigabit-networks. To that end, we will also establish a Ministry of Digital Innovation and Transformation.",,,,
4516,"We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.",,,,
4517,"We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as they do in <span class='mytooltip'>NRW<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Rhine-Westphalia</span></span>. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.",,,,
4518,"The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a so-called ‘rent moratorium’, where rent would only be able to increase with the inflation rate.",2,,,
4519,"We are vehemently against programs like rent controls. Social housing projects have failed to improve the situation - instead we need to support low income renters through housing subsidies. Regulations have to be cut back, we need slimmer bureaucracies and faster approval processes so that the market can sort itself out.",,,,

4059,"This has been an incredible wake-up call of nature. We have to evaluate what we can do to prepare for events like this in the future. For now, helping the victims has the highest priority.",,,,
4060,"First, we need to quickly and diligently help the affected regions with the cleanup operations. After that, we have to guarantee financial emergency aid for affected people, unequivocally.",2,,,
4061,"Extreme weather events are unfortunately going to become more common due to climate change. We have to do a lot more than we are doing now. This might be expensive, but the costs of doing nothing are much, much higher.",1,,,
4062,"Actually, I don’t want to be seen as performative. The cleanup operations can be left to professionals, I will keep coordinating the crisis efforts from the state chancellery so that everything goes smoothly - that’s the best I can do for the victims.",-3,,,
4063,"Of course, I want to get out there! I have to go in there with the rescue teams; I want to be seen as a man of action, with <span class='mytooltip'>rubber boots<span class='mytooltiptext'>In 2002, SPD chancellor Schröder allegedly won reelection due to media coverage of him strutting about in rubber boots during the flooding of the river Elbe.</span></span>, and shovels and all.

4065,"Of course, I want to get out there! I have to be a good leader in these times, and part of that is being seen by people.

Maybe some interviews with local media, nothing big.",2,,,1
4066,The floods have shown that we need to be much more ambitious than before. One of the worst offenders is our energy production: we need to stop using coal for energy generation by 2030 and seek out new innovative technologies to keep energy affordable.,1,,,
4067,"Climate change is coming, whether we want it or not.
