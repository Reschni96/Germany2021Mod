4500,"We are the opposite of the AfD. In times where the parliament pivots rightwards, where sexism and racism are back on the agenda, it's The Greens job to hold up high the left-liberal, emancipatory flag. If we can position ourselves as the primary voice for progressives, the media will focus on our values. And this is only the beginning.",-1,
4501,"We need to put climate change into the center of every politic. We support „Fridays For Future“ – they want an awakening, because they know, this is about the future of all of us. Let's stand with them in the streets, protesting for a cleaner and safer tomorrow. And this is only the beginning.",0,
4502,"We aren't just firmly situated in the leftist camp - we need to become the leading party of the center-left. The SPD is weak, if we can position ourselves as the more credible option for disappointed Social Democrats, especially on social policy, we will supersede them as the party of the left spectrum. And this is only the beginning.",0,
4503,"We need a fresh breath of air after these 14 years of Merkel and <span class='mytooltip'>GroKo<span class='mytooltiptext'>Abbr.“Große Koalition” - “Grand coalition”; consisting of Germany’s traditional two major parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU. Has governed from 1966-1969, 2005-2009 and 2013-2021.</span></span>'s. The progressive, modern center is getting more and more carved out – all the more important it becomes to do optimistic politics. It's now our job to make a political and societal offer, as an alternative to the status quo. And this is only the beginning.",1,
4000,"I want to detail my visions for the future in my new book: “Now - How we’re renewing our Country”. When I’ll release it this summer, I want it to be good - so I’ll focus all my energy on finishing it and making some touch-ups.",0,
4001,"If I want to become chancellor, I have to have a clean presentation, and can’t afford any sloppiness, especially as a woman. I’ll make sure things like my finances are in order and my team will check if there are any problems with my website, or other stuff on the internet.",0,
4002,"My name recognition is not that high compared to Robert. I want to get out there, go to talk shows, give interviews, and generally make sure the German people know me.",1,
4003,Friday for Future is capable of mobilizing a massive amount of people. We need to restart the “climate summer” and focus media attention on the environmentalist movement. I will visit some demonstrations and meet with the FFF-leadership to get them on our side.,0,
4004,"Overall, we support the government’s policies. I will criticize their chaotic response, but we can not endanger societal cohesion: in contrast to the AfD, we’ll make it clear that we broadly stand behind all necessary measures.",1,
4005,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, there hasn’t been enough of a focus on children and families. We need to build the circumstances to return to regular schooling, we need tests in daycares and schools, as well as fight the lack of teachers. There has to be an educational package for all kids in this country.",0,
4006,"While the lockdowns were absolutely necessary at the beginning of the pandemic, we should be mindful - there has to be a balance between freedom and safety. The curfews, for example, are a strong restriction of a basic right that might not be proportional - we always have to see if we can use milder methods.",-1,
4007,"We support measures to combat Covid, and we need to support those affected by the economic impacts, but during all this, we can not forget the climate crisis. Every summer gets warmer, and there won’t be a vaccine against climate change. Aid for industrial corporations should always be mindful of their ecological modernization.",-1,
4008,"With my candidacy, I want to make the whole country an offer —a compelling invitation to lead our diverse and prosperous nation into a bright future. Our politics needs courage to do things differently. A country that’s more just, in which daycare and schools are beautiful places, in which the state works digitally, and in which we have a foundation for welfare and security.",0,
4009,"I want the politics of a new government to make climate change the benchmark for every area, to fulfill the goals of the Paris agreement. Forty years ago, the Green Party was founded to make our politics care more about the environment. Today, I continue in this tradition, as the only candidate that truly takes climate change seriously.",-1,
4010,"After eight years of Grand coalition and sixteen years of CDU chancellorship, we need change - we need to have a new political culture. A Green chancellor candidacy stands for a new understanding of political leadership. Yes, I haven’t been chancellor or Minister: I am running for a renewal. The status quo is represented by others.",0,
4011,"The Greens are the new center. We need changes instead of promises - and now is a good time to lead a good government. Politics works in the concrete for the people: we need to do politics from the concrete and to provide agreeable policies, good compromises, for all of us. It can work!",1,
4012,"It’s clear that the SPD is not going to win this election. I want to present myself as the main candidate of the left-of-center and try to coalesce left-wing voters around the Greens. If we can make this a one-on-one against Laschet, I’m sure our appeal to change will win over the status quo.",-1,
4013,"Traditionally, the Greens have been a left-of-center party. However, these are exceptional circumstances. We need to draw voters from our main competitor, the CDU - Armin Laschet is a weak candidate, and I can present myself as a competent alternative to the status quo that he embodies. We might have to amend our rhetoric on some topics to do this.",-1,
4014,"Our base is largely young, urban, and well-off - with the right strategy, we can generate an enthusiasm unseen in past Federal Elections. They are frustrated, and we have actual credentials for them. We will put more resources into mobilization efforts to get the youth to turn out this election. Maybe we can get a Rezo-endorsement?",-2,1
4015,"Our polling numbers in West Germany are great, but we are struggling to even get to 10% in many East German states. East Germany has been neglected by the status quo for a long time, and we might be able to present our ideas of change to an untapped voter potential there.",1,
4016,"While we want to remain a member of NATO, of course, I am skeptical towards the goal to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. We can’t just raise the defense budget, we need to improve our capabilities and prevent crises before they happen.",0,
4017,"We have to be tougher on states that don’t care about human rights, like Russia and China. For example, I’m in favor of stopping the construction of the <span class='mytooltip'>Nord-Stream 2<span class='mytooltiptext'>Planned natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, through the Baltic Sea.</span></span> pipeline and stopping the import of products from China that might have been produced using forced labor.",0,
4018,"The Green Party has always been the party of pacifism. We need to overthink our levels of military spending and discuss if pure military alliances like NATO have any future. Instead, we should think more European.",-1,
4019,"I stand for a value-based foreign policy - particularly, a feminist foreign policy. We need to fight for the rights, ressources and representation of girls and women worldwide and strengthen societal diversity, to overcome violence and discrimination. A foreign policy that includes, not excludes. When women are safer, everyone is safer.",-1,
4504,"I supported Merkel's decision at the time, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency <span class='mytooltip'>Frontex<span class='mytooltiptext'>The European Agency for Border- and coastal protection of the Schengen Area (internally, the EU does not have border patrols).</span></span>.",1,
4505,"There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.",0,
4506,"Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We say: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.",0,
4507,"On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - <span class='mytooltip'>2015<span class='mytooltiptext'>In 2015, about 2 million people sought refuge in Europe, coming from the Mediterranean Sea and the Balkans. A great amount had been held up in Hungary, until Merkel unilaterally decided to let them come to Germany. About 400k Syrians fled to Germany during this time.</span></span> can’t repeat itself.",-1,
4020,"We can’t hide behind goals and numbers, we need concrete measures! If you promise a forest, you need to plant the trees. We need a government that makes climate protection the core of every political action, with a rapid Climate Protection program! We wasted a lot of time in the last few years, and we need to make up for it with swift action.",0,1
4021,"The Federal Courts have given us a clear message: if you protect the climate, you’re protecting freedom. Five years ago, this house ratified the Paris climate accords. Every democratic party here agrees that something needs to be done, so let’s find solutions together.",1,
4022,"This is no room for party-political games, we have an obligation to act here and today. The CDU has failed us for 16 years, and the SPD is complicit! Climate protection through Sunday speeches doesn’t suffice. They have failed to promote renewable energies and endangered countless jobs!",-1,
4023,"We have had many transformations in the history of this country: Introducing the social market economy after World War 2, the reunification and European integration after 1990. Now is the time for another transformation: a Green New Deal for Europe, in an alliance with the USA. This problem can only be solved internationally.",0,
4024,"Robert is a lovably stoic North German. As a former minister, he’s bound to be popular in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein - I want him to utilize his local connections and charm there, to give us the inroads with rural voters that we need. On the national stage however, I want myself to be center stage.",-2,
4025,"We are co-party leaders and I want to campaign a lot as a dynamic duo. While I’ll focus on climate protection, foreign policy and general leadership, he’s especially knowledgeable on economic and fiscal policy, so I want him to focus on his strengths there.",2,
4026,"Robert ist the one with government experience here. I’ll mostly talk about my visions for the country, our Green ideology and our stance against the status quo, while he can focus on the policy details and explaining them to the common voter.",0,
4027,"As a woman, any critiques I’ll say will get torn up by the media as unlikeable and hysterical - just think of Hillary Clinton. Robert might be able to help us here - he can serve as our attack dog on Laschet and Scholz, while I remain above the fray with a positive attitude.",1,
4028,"I will apologize for this mistake, I’ve reported these earnings now. This wasn’t a big deal, but it was still unnecessary and frustrating. This will not reflect my chancellorship - I hope people will quickly move on from this.",-2,
4029,"I admit, this was a small lapse of judgment - but it’s nothing compared to the corrupt mask deals in the CDU/CSU and Scholz’ <span class='mytooltip'>Wirecard<span class='mytooltiptext'>Financial company, who ran a bank until 2020, when they shut down due to several billion Euros missing. The regulatory organization under Minister of Finances Olaf Scholz was heavily criticized for its lack of action.</span></span> and cum-ex scandals. I am still the candidate with the most integrity; I stand by my mistakes and fix them, while Laschet staves off critics and Scholz can’t even remember.",-3,
4030,"Other politicians have received much higher payments in the same timeframe, and also haven’t reported them. This is why the Green Party stands for more transparency regarding the earnings of MPs. Our party actually acts on these promises.",-1,
4031,"I grew up in the countryside myself, I know you need a car there - we broadly need a switch to cleaner cars though. If we want to lower our carbon emissions, under my plan, the price of gasoline has to rise by about 16 cents per liter over the next five years.",-1,
4032,"Mainly, we want to strengthen public transit and alternative sources of fuel. As the price of CO2 rises, so will the price of gasoline. We have to keep an eye on affordability, but unfortunately, a price hike is unavoidable. The question is, are we leaving everything the same, or will we finally change something?",0,
4033,"As climate change gets worse, we need to be resolute. Gas prices have to rise a lot - around 28 cents per liter over the next five years. We need to invest in public transit as well to make individual traffic less attractive overall. Buses and trains are where our future lies.",-2,
4034,"With our crumbling public transport, cars are necessary for our rural population. After the price for CO2 went into effect at the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen by 6 cents per liter already - for now, this is enough. Climate protection still has to be affordable.",1,
4035,"We need to replace the Hartz IV-system with a “citizen’s money”, in which recipients would receive at least 50€ more. There should be no more sanctions if someone isn’t actively looking for a job, and there will be other reliefs, in the form of price caps on gas and electrical energy.",0,
4036,"The current level of Hartz IV is a disgrace. The system needs to be reworked from the ground-up, and needs to be a massive raise, by around 200€, accounting for inflation. The sanctions are also unnecessary and inhumane, they should end. We also need further aid, like basic child security funding.",0,
4037,"Instead of Hartz IV, there should be a higher, universal basic income for all people in Germany, around 1200€ as a minimum income. While this is expensive, the savings on bureaucracy make it possible to finance this.",0,1
4038,"The system needs some minor adjustments - we can look into gradually raising the amount of money paid out and lessen the applied sanctions. However, we have to be careful that it doesn’t become excessive - overall, the Hartz system is sound.",0,
4508,"There’s a wind of change blowing through Germany: climate change is finally taken seriously by the media. We are perceived as most competent on this issue - as long as we press the attack and define a solid profile on climate action, we can keep up our momentum all the way to election day.",0,
4509,"I think the people are tired of politics-as-usual, especially after 16 years of Merkel. I will run on an optimistic take - “Germany can do so much more”. Let’s stand by our stances and campaign on the issues without getting intimidated - ignore the mudslinging, and trust in our sympathy levels.",1,
4510,"Of course, people want change - but in order for them to follow through, we need to make our rhetoric and policies palatable to the average voter. Our goal is first place after all - Kretschmann showed us how it works in Baden-Württemberg. Let’s present ourselves as a stately new party, ready to govern.",0,
4039,"The most important points in my CV are accurate. I do apologize for these mistakes and the impression it unwillingly gave, but these errors have all been corrected now. I’ve learned my lesson. We can move on to other topics.",-3,
4040,"This is a non-issue. The main points are there, and this is just a misunderstanding. It’s clear what’s happening here: the media and my opponents are trying to derail our momentum by pushing nonsense-narratives on the only female in the race.",-4,
4041,"If you want to see my correct CV, just look at my website - I don’t get what people are getting so upset about. Everything on there is in order, there is no scandal here.",-5,
4042,"Oh come on… it was never my goal to embellish my CV, I just made some honest mistakes here. I have to admit, I'm really annoyed with myself for letting this slip through. That said, I’ve followed my responsibility and cleaned this up. I didn’t want to make myself seem greater than I am, and all I can do now is to keep earning your trust.",-2,
4043,"The Grand coalition has failed Germany in this regard, as was plain to see during the lockdowns. Under a Green government, we need to invest a lot of resources into modernizing the digital infrastructure of this country - including a right to a fast internet connection.",0,1
4044,"We need a great European cloud-infrastructure based on Open Source technology, to provide for a great amount of data for the development of AI. We need to invest into AI, to improve Germany as a location for High Tech businesses. We also need regulations around AI usage in art and science.",0,
4045,"It’s disappointing how much government agencies still rely on old-fashioned methods. We have to invest massively to introduce more modern systems. We need to make non-personalized data public and to introduce a digital identity for every citizen on their phone - of course, protected by good IT-security.",1,1
4046,"We need to focus on data protection. Big Tech has to be regulated in its data usage, and our data has to be kept safe from American companies. We will defend the right for privacy, particularly in light of the information unveiled by Edward Snowden.",0,
4047,This is something I will fight for -  we need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h to reduce carbon emissions. We have to hit our emission targets somehow and reducing traffic emissions is one part of that - the situation won’t fix itself.,0,
4048,"We need a “safety limit”: A lot of accidents and deaths could be avoided if people wouldn’t be speeding excessively. There are studies showing that with a tempo limit, the number of accidents and traffic victims decrease. This can save lives. It’s a matter of common sense.",1,
4049,"We shouldn’t overestimate the effects of a tempo limit on climate change. With this being a divisive topic, we aren’t planning on focusing on this in the next legislative session. However, we will look into introducing new tempo limits on selected highways, as they already exist on certain streets.",0,
4050,"To reach the climate goals for 2030, we need to massively save on CO² in our traffic. We need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h on highways, 80 km/h outside of cities and 30 km/h within city limits - this will have a crucial part in our fight against climate change.",-1,1
4511,"The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.",0,
4512,"A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.",0,
4513,"It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.",0,
4514,"We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.",0,
4051,"I’ve made some mistakes, yes, but these accusations from some conservative blogger are unfair and completely blown out of proportion. I will get a media lawyer to fight back- this comes close to character-assassination.",-1,
4052,"It was a mistake to publish the book in its current state and I apologize for this lapse in judgment. My intention was not to deceive anyone, I simply quoted widely available facts, and as this isn’t a scientific paper, I didn’t think a bibliography was necessary. Now, we should keep talking about the issues that matter most.",-1,
4053,"This book hasn’t been written by just me, I had a co-author. I’ll make it clear that most of the problematic parts were his responsibility and I didn’t have much to do with them - although I should’ve vetted him a bit better..",-3,
4054,"What a double standard. This is a popular non-fiction book, not a scientific article. Let’s point to Armin Laschet - in his 2009 book, there are several plagiarized passages, and they’re finding more and more. Why aren’t they talking about that?",-2,
4515,"We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.",1,
4516,"We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards, available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as we do in <span class='mytooltip'>NRW<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Rhine-Westphalia</span></span>. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.",0,
4517,"The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a rent moratorium.",0,1
4518,"Apartments are people's homes, not investments. We can’t afford half measures: we need a federal rent freeze in regions where the capitalist market failed, lower existing costs, if necessary with expropriations. We need new social housing units and the renovation of old buildings - we can even look at legalizing squatting, if it serves the reappropriation of misused spaces.",-1,1
4055,"No, it would be improper to try to politicize this catastrophe. I’m going to enjoy my vacation and the time with my family - some small statements over social media and to the press should be enough.",-3,
4056,"My god, yes of course I will cancel the rest of my vacation. I have to travel to some of the affected regions, to take a look at the carnage myself - but let’s be careful and avoid opportunism. I’m gonna talk to our local ministers in Rheinland-Pfalz and take some trips to the sites of the catastrophe, but I don’t want any media accompaniment or any broad statements.",1,
4057,"You’re right, I need to show my leadership during these tough times. Specifically, I want to meet with Minister of the Environment Anne Spiegel in Rhineland-Palatinate, and visit the Green Party mayors of Bonn and Wuppertal. I’ll look at the devastation and make a public statement with them.",2,
4058,"You’re right, I can’t keep vacationing under these circumstances, but I also don’t want to seem opportunistic. What about a surrogate? Robert is good at talking to people in situations like this. Let’s ask him to go -  I’ll of course still comment on my own.",0,
4059,"You know, we haven't been working on this topic since only yesterday. For decades, The Green Party has stood for a stronger stance on environmentalism. Germany is not prepared for the effects of climate change - that’s why we call, for example, for an end of using coal to produce electricity by 2030, as even Markus Söder does.",0,
4060,"I don’t want to come across as wanting to profit from this disaster. After a short, expected mention of climate change, I will primarily talk about basic topics like introducing a better Cell Broadcasting system, a construction ban in areas with high risk of flooding and an overall better national disaster control strategy.",0,
4061,"I don’t just want to promise climate action, I want to make it concrete. We need to be more ambitious: to that end, I want to produce concrete proposals for centralized action against climate change, as well as unveil a decisive instant-climate-protection-program that we would enact in government.",1,1
4062,I want to specifically call out Armin Laschet here - he said that a day like this is no reason to change the politics. What else does he need to see to realize that something must be done? We can’t afford this wish-wash by the Union on climate anymore.,0,
4519,"We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.",0,
4520,"We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.",0,
4521,"There are certainly more pressing matters than some power plays in the small Saarland. Let them deal with it on their own, I want to concentrate on the national campaign.",0,
4522,"Let’s not get derailed - make them change the statutes so Ulrich can stay in the top spot. The delegates democratically voted for him, so we’ll have to accept this result. We can deal with anything further after the election.",-1,
4063,Robert Habeck is currently on a pretty popular tour across the North Sea coast. Let’s join him to show the unity of our party and produce some great pictures of us as the ‘dynamic duo’!,1,
4064,"Winfried Kretschman, the only Green Minister-President, has just won his reelection this spring and is very popular, particularly among moderates and conservatives. In order to broaden our appeal and show off competent Green governance, I want to campaign with him in Baden-Württemberg and South Germany in general.",0,
4065,"I’m quite content with our polling numbers in West Germany, but we are still far behind in East Germany. I don’t just want to be perceived as a chancellor of the west - to not get completely pummeled there, I want to focus my visits on the New States, to make them feel heard and activate traditional non-voters.",1,
4066,"The states of Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have their state elections parallel to our federal elections. To further our standing as a national party, a good result is crucial there. As such, let’s campaign with our top candidates, Bettina Jarasch and Anne Shepley, to show off the strength of Green women!",0,
4067,"If everyone has gotten an offer for a vaccine, we shouldn’t rule out that vaccinated people might be able to do more than the unvaccinated. It can’t be that the freedoms of everyone are getting restricted because some don’t want to get the shot.",0,
4068,"We are doing a lot to get everyone vaccinated right now without thinking about the consequences. What if the vaccine is toxic? We shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead.",-3,
4069,"Mandatory vaccinations aren’t easy to implement - but we have to think of the alternatives. If our children have to undergo further lockdowns, we will need a general vaccine mandate in Germany, to protect them and those who did everything they could to uphold our medical system.",0,
4070,"Overall, we are on the right path with the vaccination campaign. We need to do more to reach everyone though, including mobile vaccination teams that can provide coverage to areas with low vaccination rates.",1,
4523,"Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.",0,
4524,"We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.",-1,
4525,"Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.",0,1
4526,"We don’t just want to legalize Cannabis, but also decriminalize small amounts of hard party drugs like XTC, cocaine and amphetamines. The criminalization of drug consumers is a relic from the last century, the ‘right for intoxication’ should be self-evident.",-1,1
4071,"I’m very concerned about this development. We need to become more visible, and turn some heads towards Scholz’ own vulnerabilities. In the next few weeks, I will focus on attacking him and his party on their broken promises and shady dealings like cum-ex and <span class='mytooltip'>Wirecard<span class='mytooltiptext'>Financial company, who ran a bank until 2020, when they shut down due to several billion Euros missing. The regulatory organization under Minister of Finances Olaf Scholz was heavily criticized for its lack of action.</span></span>.",-2,
4072,"Of course, I’m very disappointed about this. However, honestly, we are still very likely going to be part of the next government and I’d rather govern with Scholz than with Laschet. I don’t want to jeopardize this: instead, the two men won’t be able to refrain from attacks, and I'll calmly rise above the pack.",1,
4073,"That’s too bad, but this is no time to get disheartened because of numbers. We know we are fighting for the right thing - let’s motivate ourselves and reinvent this campaign, new rallies, new posters, more media interviews: that way, we can heighten our visibility and draw a good contrast to Scholz’s unwavering borefest.",1,
4074,"To finance necessary government spending, taxes on the rich have to be raised. We should reinstate the wealth tax and raise the income tax, but in a way that leaves small and medium-income earners unaffected.",0,
4075,"Effectively combating climate change is our number one priority, and to finance this, there might have to be certain tax increases on goods like meat or dairy. The wealthy will of course have to bear the highest increase, but everyone will have to contribute more - if we invest in our future, the financial effort will come back manifold.",-2,
4076,"We need to raise taxes on the rich a bit, yes. However, more importantly, we need to abandon the ‘<span class='mytooltip'>Black Zero<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Schwarze Null” in German; economic principle that forbids new debts while promising a balanced budget.</span></span>’ and reform the debt ceiling in our constitution. It is economically sound to invest in certain projects, especially considering the current interest rates.",0,1
4077,"Climate action doesn’t have to be expensive; particularly policies friendly to innovation, tax rebates for eco-friendly technologies and a higher CO²-price in emission trading can help us combat climate change without high expenditures. Of course, we are proposing more than that, but we’re sure that noticeable tax increases can be avoided.",1,
4078,"We need to send the Union back to the opposition - they are the party of standstill. While we definitely advocate for a stricter line on climate change, the party we have the most overlap with is the SPD. In the end, maybe it’ll even be enough for an alliance solely between Green and Red.",0,
4079,"While we of course disavow any cooperation with the AfD, I also can not imagine a good working relationship with Die Linke. I want to see an administration that takes responsibility in the world - if we don’t share common ground on foreign policy, there is no basis for a government.",0,
4080,"Equating Die Linke with the far right AfD, as the CDU does, is wildly dangerous. The best path to real change in our government lies in a cooperation of the three leftist parties: such an arrangement has worked in several states already, so I’m certain we can find compromises on contentious topics.",0,
4081,"This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition.",0,
4527,"While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.",0,
4528,"We want to strike $218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.",0,1
4529,"The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.",0,
4530,"We need to immediately strike § 218 and $ 219 - instead, the right to free, simple and accessible abortions has to be guaranteed; state-built hospitals should be required to perform the procedure. Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance.",0,1
4082,"Weeks ago, The Greens proposed to get local German staff to safety, but SPD and Union refused.

4120,It’s a good sign for us that the SPD is down in polls - but they’re still a formidable voting block. Their voters should be easiest to win over - let’s target them specifically by emphasizing our socio-economic program and consolidate the center-left around us.,0,
4121,"It looks like Die Linke might struggle to reach the 5%-hurdle. I am clearly the best option for a leftist government - by pressing on this issue, we could keep them out of government and simplify finding a majority. Maybe it’ll even be enough for Green-Red!",0,

4123,"Mr. Laschet’s crisis responses are erratic and unreliable. He can not hold a clear line on Covid, he can not stand up to pressure and corruption from his own party, and his response to the disastrous floods this summer shows that he lacks the temperament to be a good chancellor. Germany deserves someone better than him.",0,
4124,"How convenient that the Union pivots to social policies only when we’re talking about fighting climate change. Mr. Laschet has to realize that the Paris agreement isn’t voluntary!

4125,"For the last 16 years, this country has been governed by the CDU/CSU, and they are out of ideas on what to do in government.

4127,"The CDU/CSU has been in government for 16 years, the SPD for 8. There are only two options - will we duck behind the continuity of the Grand Coalition of CDU and SPD, or will we accomplish real change?  We are far behind on many issues - it’s time for a Green chancellorship!",0,
4128,There is one issue that really matters in this election: Climate change! I’m the only one to have a program that’s ambitious enough to truly make a difference. I will not keep making half-measures on climate action like the Grand Coalition: the next government has to be a climate-government.,0,1
4129,"I’d like to focus on our social policies. It’s not the fault of climate action that people get paid too little, that the minimum wage is too low and that every fifth child lives in poverty. That’s because of policies that intend to mainly relieve high-earners and which do not look at poverty in Germany.",0,
4130,"Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. These old white men need someone to tell them how it is. Years and years of standstill, and these just won’t admit that we need change. Someone has to stand up and fight!",0,
4131,"This is simply not as much of a big deal as people make of it. I don’t even get an income as party chair. These payments, while I should’ve reported them, are small peanuts, and the parliament hasn’t even asked me to report them, I did that on my own initiative. Frankly, these criticisms smell like sexism!",-3,
4132,"Not only that, I want to show off the plethora of ideas that The Greens are putting up. Robert wrote a phenomenal book called “Von hier an anders: Eine politische Skizze”, and I want him to show his work off prominently as well.",-1,
4535,"I stand by my course: 2011, 2018 and 2019 showed us how Germany is fed up with the excuses on climate change. On this issue, our politics has lost all links to reality, because it’s not radical enough. We can not decide against all the knowledge and all the facts about climate change, we need to do something!",0,
4536,"Stateliness and radicalism aren’t opposites! To really change something, we can’t just swallow the unshackling of global capitalism. We decided on taxing the rich as a party, but we’d be crazy if we didn’t think on a grander scale: instead of arguing about the instruments, we need to ask some critical questions about our economic system!",-3,
4537,"Look, I get it. We need to win societal and parliamentary majorities, so that our country becomes more just. If that means tampering our rhetoric a bit, so be it. It is our job to provide a good offer for the progressive-left center of this country, and while that includes classically leftist answers, it also goes beyond them.",-1,
4538,"Ideology isn’t that important to me. I want to answer questions on important issues: what about older people in rural areas, what about the education system, the origins of poverty? We need to listen to different people; environmental protection, social justice and economic prosperity don’t contradict themselves. As a modern party, let us cast a broad net.",1,
4539,"Look, ecological goals don’t just have to be ambitious, they have to be reachable, and affordable. We need to leave the image of a “prohibitory party” behind us - frankly, we have failed in the past with tax-raising-debates - instead we should support sensible, workable policies. Work from within the system - sticking to dogma doesn’t get us anywhere.",-1,
4540,"I wanted to broaden our appeal by showing how we’re open to all of society, open to other arguments. That said, our party needs a strongly defined profile, I agree. In the coming campaign, we should increasingly emphasize our environmentalism and center-left attitude.",-1,
