PK,Description
"4500","We are the opposite of the AfD. In times where the parliament pivots rightwards, where sexism and racism are back on the agenda, it's The Greens job to hold up high the left-liberal, emancipatory flag. If we can position ourselves as the primary voice for progressives, the media will focus on our values. And this is only the beginning."
"4501","We need to put climate change into the center of every politic. We support „<span class='mytooltip'>Fridays For Future<span class='mytooltiptext'>An international grassroots movement since 2018, advocating for students to skip school or Uni and protest for climate action instead. Originated in Greta Thunberg’s “Skolstrejk För Klimatet” in Sweden.</span></span>“ – they want an awakening, because they know, this is about the future of all of us. Let's stand with them in the streets, protesting for a cleaner and safer tomorrow. And this is only the beginning."
"4502","We aren't just firmly situated in the leftist camp - we need to become the leading party of the center-left. The SPD is weak, if we can position ourselves as the more credible option for disappointed Social Democrats, especially on social policy, we will supersede them as the party of the left spectrum. And this is only the beginning."
"4503","We need a fresh breath of air after these 14 years of Merkel and <span class='mytooltip'>GroKo<span class='mytooltiptext'>Abbr.“Große Koalition” - “Grand coalition”, consisting of Germany’s traditional two major parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU. Has governed from 1966-1969, 2005-2009 and 2013-2021.</span></span>'s. The progressive, modern center is getting more and more carved out – all the more important it becomes to do optimistic politics. It's now our job to make a political and societal offer, as an alternative to the status quo. And this is only the beginning."
"4000","Two years ago, I deleted my social media accounts. However, in this day and age, you need social media for a successful election campaign. I will reactivate them and start posting!"
"4001","If I want to become chancellor, I have to have a clean presentation, and can’t afford any sloppiness. I’ll make sure things like my finances are in order and my team will check if there are any problems with my website, or other stuff on the internet."
"4002","I want to get out there, go to talk shows, give interviews, and generally make sure the German people know me. This should improve both my name recognition and my favorability ratings."
"4003","Friday for Future is capable of mobilizing a massive amount of people. We need to restart the “climate summer” and focus media attention on the environmentalist movement. I will visit some demonstrations and meet with the <span class='mytooltip'>FFF<span class='mytooltiptext'>‘Fridays For Future’, an international grassroots movement since 2018, advocating for students to skip school or Uni and protest for climate action instead. Originated in Greta Thunberg’s “Skolstrejk För Klimatet” in Sweden.</span></span>-leadership to get them on our side."
"4004","Overall, we support the government’s policies. I will criticize their chaotic response, but we can not endanger societal cohesion: in contrast to the AfD, we’ll make it clear that we broadly stand behind all necessary measures."
"4005","Since the beginning of the pandemic, there hasn’t been enough of a focus on children and families. We need to build the circumstances to return to regular schooling, we need tests in daycares and schools, as well as fight the lack of teachers. There has to be an educational package for all kids in this country."
"4006","While the lockdowns were absolutely necessary at the beginning of the pandemic, we should be mindful - there has to be a balance between freedom and safety. The curfews, for example, are a strong restriction of a basic right that might not be proportional - we always have to see if we can use milder methods."
"4007","We support measures to combat Covid and to rebuild our economy. Most importantly though, this was the first time that healthcare was more important than profit interests and growth. The lesson here is that we need to design our economy around common interests, including environmental protection. The time of small compromises is over."
"4008","I want to establish a new style of governance in Germany. The Greens are offering up a new idea of politics. We need to be radical and stately: to be consistent and progressive, but also to listen to every argument. I offer you change, through this new kind of politics, and will use my government experience to lead Germany into a new age."
"4009","We need a livable future for our country. We need the whole arsenal of politics, not just a higher price for Co², to fulfill this gigantic transformatory task of stopping climate change. We have to become completely climate neutral over the next 20 years. If we protect the climate, we're protecting ourselves: and I am running to do just that."
"4010","Through elections, a country decides its future. Eight years of Grand coalition and sixteen years of CDU chancellorship haven’t given us answers for our future - and a lack of answers is evident of a lack of responsibility. This can not continue: a Green chancellor candidacy offers Germany a new future, away from the politics of standstill."
"4011","The Greens are the new center. We need changes instead of promises, to continue our fight for an open and tolerant society, but this society has to serve the broad masses. It is cohesion and solidarity that’s at the center of our “politics of partnership”. The change we need is only possible with majorities of the German people, through workable compromises."
"4012","It’s clear that the SPD is not going to win this election, and we need it to stay that way. I want to present myself as the main candidate of the left-of-center and try to coalesce left-wing voters around the Greens. If we can make this a one-on-one against Söder, I’m sure our appeal to change will win over the status quo."
"4013","Traditionally, the Greens have been left of center. However, these are exceptional circumstances. We need to draw votes from our main competitor, the Union - Markus Söder is a strong candidate, and he needs to be taken down a notch if we want to compete with him over centrists. We might have to amend our rhetoric on some topics to do this."
"4014","Our base is largely young, urban, and well-off - with the right strategy, we can generate an enthusiasm unseen in past Federal Elections. They are frustrated, and we have actual credentials for them. We will put more resources into mobilization efforts to get the youth to turn out this election. Maybe we can get a <span class='mytooltip'>Rezo<span class='mytooltiptext'>German Youtuber. Usually a musician and entertainer, but in 2019 he became known for the video “The Destruction of the CDU”. It contained a blistering critique of the CDU’s climate policies, well researched and thoroughly sourced. It got unprecedented good reviews from journalists. Some say it had a tangible effect on the European elections that year.</span></span>-endorsement?"
"4015","Our polling numbers in West Germany are great, but we are struggling to even get to 10% in many East German states. East Germany has been neglected by the status quo for a long time, and we might be able to present our ideas of change to an untapped voter potential there."
"4016","While we stand by <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955. Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span> and a value-based realism on foreign policy, I am skeptical towards the goal to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. We can’t just raise the defense budget, we need to improve our capabilities and prevent crises before they happen."
"4017","We need to drive a tougher line against Russian aggression in the east. We are not just against <span class='mytooltip'>Nord-Stream 2<span class='mytooltiptext'>Planned natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, through the Baltic Sea.</span></span>, I also favor sending defensive weapons to Ukraine. If you really take a look at that conflict, we can’t deny them help for their self defense."
"4018","The Green party has always been the party of pacifism. We need to overthink our levels of military spending and are against weapon exports to crisis regions and dictatorships. We need a more restrictive control of arms exports in the <span class='mytooltip'>EU<span class='mytooltiptext'>European Union; supranational political entity, serving as a political and economic union between 27 European countries, including free trade, open borders, political cooperation and a common legislative body. Germany is a prominent member, being one of its predecessors founding members, going back to the post-war era.</span></span>."
"4019","We don’t want to rock the boat here. Let’s let Annalena make some statements, she’s the foreign policy expert. I just want to reaffirm our commitment to <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955. Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span> while emphasizing that wars can only be solved diplomatically."
"4504","I supported Merkel's decision at the time, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the <span class='mytooltip'>EU<span class='mytooltiptext'>European Union; supranational political entity, serving as a political and economic union between 27 European countries, including free trade, open borders, political cooperation and a common legislative body. Germany is a prominent member, being one of its predecessors founding members, going back to the post-war era.</span></span> border enforcement agency <span class='mytooltip'>Frontex<span class='mytooltiptext'>The European Agency for Border- and coastal protection of the Schengen Area (internally, the EU does not have border patrols).</span></span>."
"4505","There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation."
"4506","Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We say: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean."
"4507","On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the <span class='mytooltip'>EU<span class='mytooltiptext'>European Union; supranational political entity, serving as a political and economic union between 27 European countries, including free trade, open borders, political cooperation and a common legislative body. Germany is a prominent member, being one of its predecessors founding members, going back to the post-war era.</span></span> and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - <span class='mytooltip'>2015<span class='mytooltiptext'>In 2015, about 2 million people sought refuge in Europe, coming from the Mediterranean Sea and the Balkans. A great amount had been held up in Hungary, until Merkel unilaterally decided to let them come to Germany. About 400k Syrians fled to Germany during this time.</span></span> can’t repeat itself."
"4020","There's a real chance here to make some big strides together. However, the current proposal does not do that - it doesn't just suffice to have stricter goals, we need a big package with concrete measures, concerning an exit from coal, renewable energies and the striking of environmentally harmful subsidies."
"4021","This decision isn't just about the numbers. It's about a categorical shift in our understanding of politics - the courts' explanation was built not on environmentalism, but on Freedom. If you protect the climate, you protect freedoms. It's not just about free markets versus rules - It is rules and guidelines which make us free in the first place! On these grounds, we need to readjust our climate policy together."
"4022","This is no room for party-political games, we have an obligation to act here and today. The CDU has failed us for 16 years, and the SPD is complicit! Climate protection through Sunday speeches doesn’t suffice. They have failed to promote renewable energies and endangered countless jobs!"
"4023","The government has readjusted the numbers in its law. They might not be enough for Paris, but they are already ambitious. What we need now are the means to meet these goals; to use all means possible to fulfill this gigantic task. Of course we need smart investments through the state, but we also need the free markets and entrepreneurship to fulfill this societal quest."
"4024","This was a decision we made together, Annalena and I agreed that I would be the more electable candidate. Besides, it’s kinda sexist on its own to say that she should have gotten the nomination just because she’s a woman."
"4025","I recognize that we have a problem with not enough women being in the highest positions of power. That’s why I promise that as chancellor, half of my cabinet will consist of women, and we will look at extensive measures to advance the equality of all genders in Germany."
"4026","Annalena and I are co-party leaders and she will play a crucial part in this campaign. I want to campaign more frequently on her side, with her being our main voice on foreign policy and similar matters."
"4027","It’s important that we stay united as a party if we want to win this election, and we can’t keep lingering on questions of personalities, as the Union so often does. Annalena Baerbock and I agreed that I should be the candidate, but she will of course have a bright political future in this country, for example with a prominent spot in my cabinet."
"4028","It was a wise decision to delete my Twitter account, I stand by that. The platform is not good for political discourse - and the young and cool people are somewhere else anyway. Besides, there are Green Party accounts for people to follow if they want to stay up to date."
"4029","What I really meant to say was, that it’s unhealthy for Bavaria to be governed by the CSU alone and how Thuringia is under attack from antidemocratic forces on the right. It’s disgusting how certain political actors are now using my personal decisions to further their political aims."
"4030","Twitter is encouraging a polemic style of discussion. The aggressiveness, loudness and pointedness of that platform, combined with its fast pace makes it difficult to sit down and think. Furthermore, they are blatantly stealing data - we need further regulation of social media firms."
"4031","I can only wonder about the obliviousness and self righteousness of the other parties. A higher price on CO² is effective in combating climate change, as we all agree - we stand for a price hike of 16 cents per liter over the next five years. People with poorer income will be relieved through measures to tax the wealthy more than we do now."
"4032","Mainly, we want to strengthen public transit and alternative sources of fuel. Of course, higher prices for consumers and at the gas station would impact people differently, according to income. My focus is on politically compensating this inequality, and giving back any earnings from the CO²-price to the citizens - households with smaller incomes would profit the most from this."
"4033","At the end of the day, traffic must be completely free of emissions. “Freedom through the car” is an illusion that we’re still living today - instead, we need to look towards collective methods of transport. Gas prices will have to rise around 28 cents, and in individual cities, a City-road-toll could be useful. Buses and trains are where our future lies."
"4034","No environmental protection will hurt us. After the price for CO2 went into effect at the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen by 6 cents per liter already - we should work within that constraint. The key here is more infrastructure for electrical cars, and the import of renewable energy to fuel them."
"4035","This is more of a problem with the whole party than with me personally. To counter this image, I want to work with concrete proposals, to put a bigger focus on our programs to help poor and disadvantaged people in this country."
"4036","When I was minister in Schleswig-Holstein, I talked with everyone, even with people who would never vote Green. We should listen more, what stories are there in our society, what kind of experiences move the people? That’s where we have to connect."
"4037","This is a problem all parties in the Bundestag struggle with - there are many more people with a college degree than without in our parliament. We all have to work together to change this."
"4038","I disagree, I believe my education might be of use. We can further consolidate high education voters and provide my campaign with a unique visionary angle. I want to show off my credentials and my degree at several speeches in the coming months."
"4039","We need to replace the Hartz IV-system with a “citizen’s money”, in which recipients would receive at least 50€ more. There should be no more sanctions if someone isn’t actively looking for a job, and there will be other reliefs, in the form of price caps on gas and electrical energy."
"4040","The current level of Hartz IV is a disgrace. The system needs to be reworked from the ground-up, and needs to be a massive raise, by around 200€, accounting for inflation. The sanctions are also unnecessary and inhumane, they should end. We also need further aid, like basic child security funding."
"4041","We need another social system. The times have moved on from Hartz IV. There are so many transformation processes, where many individual problems will come up, that we can't leave everyone to their own. We need basic protections for people, not just to force them to work without dignity. That's why I propose a universal basic income of 1200€ per month."
"4042","The system needs some minor adjustments - we can look into gradually raising the amount of money and lessen sanctions. However, we have to be careful that it doesn’t become excessive - people shouldn’t be invited to infinitely put up the heating, because we’re paying for it. They should have incentives to be careful about their energy consumption."
"4508","There’s a wind of change blowing through Germany: climate change is finally taken seriously by the media. We are perceived as most competent on this issue - as long as we press the attack and define a solid profile on climate action, we can keep up our momentum all the way to election day."
"4509","I think the people are tired of politics-as-usual, especially after 16 years of Merkel. I will run on an optimistic take - “Germany can do so much more”. Let’s stand by our stances and campaign on the issues without getting intimidated - ignore the mudslinging, and trust in our sympathy levels."
"4510","Of course, people want change - but in order for them to follow through, we need to make our rhetoric and policies palatable to the average voter. Our goal is first place after all - Kretschmann showed us how it works in Baden-Württemberg. Let’s present ourselves as a stately new party, ready to govern."
"4043","Germany is abhorrently underdigitalized. Digitalization must be organized from the top, with a right to a fast internet connection and significant investments that the current government has slept on. However, I believe a dedicated ministry would hamper these efforts, through bureaucratic red tape."
"4044","We need a great European cloud-infrastructure based on Open Source technology, to provide for a great amount of data for the development of AI. We need to invest into AI, to improve Germany as a location for High Tech businesses. We also need regulations around AI usage in art and science."
"4045","There’s too little investment for the digital furnishing of Germany’s public services.  During the Covid-pandemic, the bureaucracy hasn’t even been able to give out digital vaccination appointments! We need less paper files and innovative solutions, like a digital personal identity with good data protection."
"4046","We need to focus on data protection. Big Tech has to be regulated in its data usage, and our data has to be kept safe from American companies. We will defend the right for privacy, particularly in light of the information unveiled by Edward Snowden."
"4047","A tempo limit of 130 km/h will be one of the first measures of my administration."
"4048","We need a “safety limit”: A lot of accidents and deaths could be avoided if people wouldn’t be speeding excessively. There is no right of endangering others for the sake of fun. There is no right for speeding in Germany."
"4049","We shouldn’t overestimate the effects of a tempo limit on climate change. With this being a divisive topic, we aren’t planning on focusing on this in the next legislative session. However, we will look into introducing new tempo limits on selected highways, as they already exist on certain streets."
"4050","In light of the Covid pandemic, the allegation that a tempo limit would be an unseemly restriction of our freedoms sound ridiculous, after churches, schools etc. have been closed. We need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h on highways, 80 km/h outside of cities and 30 km/h within city limits - this might save up around 1.9 billion tons of CO² per year."
"4511","The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future."
"4512","A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system."
"4513","It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty."
"4514","We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds."
"4051","I know it’s kinda harsh, but I’m gonna talk to Annalena about this - she can’t drag this campaign down with these issues. For the rest of the campaign, I hope she’ll take a step back into the background."
"4052","Annalena Baerbock has already admitted that these were mistakes, and of course they were regrettable. However, now that everything is in order, we shouldn’t be distracted from more important topics. We need to talk about the policies!"
"4053","These allegations are unfair and part of a right-wing smear campaign against the Green Party in general. I will fight back and defend Annalena whenever I’m asked about this."
"4054","The CDU/CSU was involved in a massive scandal with many of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks. Scholz of the SPD oversaw the disastrous <span class='mytooltip'>Wirecard<span class='mytooltiptext'>Financial company, who ran a bank until 2020, when they shut down due to several billion Euros missing. The regulatory organization under Minister of Finances Olaf Scholz was heavily criticized for its lack of action, despite being informed about the inconsistencies.</span></span> collapse and was involved in corrupt <span class='mytooltip'>cum-ex<span class='mytooltiptext'>Stock-trading scheme. Goal is to get several refunds from capital gains taxes that were paid just once. A prominent case is the Hamburg-based Warburg-Bank, who defrauded the state. While Olaf Scholz was mayor, he secretly met with their chair multiple times.</span></span> banking deals. Compared to that, Baerbock’s missteps are insignificant."
"4515","We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home."
"4516","We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards, available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as we do in <span class='mytooltip'>NRW<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Rhine-Westphalia</span></span>. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes."
"4517","The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a rent moratorium."
"4518","Apartments are people's homes, not investments. We can’t afford half measures: we need a federal rent freeze in regions where the capitalist market failed, lower existing costs, if necessary with expropriations. We need new social housing units and the renovation of old buildings - we can even look at legalizing squatting, if it serves the reappropriation of misused spaces."
"4055","No, it would be improper to try to politicize this catastrophe. I’m of course making statements in support of the emergency responders, but I won’t go there myself just to get some pictures. I will rise above this opportunism."
"4056","This is absolutely horrible. I will travel to some of the affected regions, yes. However, I don’t want to abuse this situation for press coverage, I want to show restraint and talk in a more intimate setting to the affected."
"4057","Yeah, we definitely need to go there. Specifically, I want to visit the Green mayors of Wuppertal and Bonn. It is tragic and horrible, how this catastrophe had to remind us of climate change; when we protect our environment, we're protecting human lives, and with it, our open society."
"4058","Of course, I want to travel there, talk to affected people and show myself as a man of action. We need to listen to the people and help out with the cleanup - when disaster strikes, a chancellor should be there for the people."
"4059","The Grand Coalition wasn't good enough at combating this crisis of a generation. We need concrete measures: there should be a climate task force in the federal government, headed by the Ministry of the Environment, who should be able to veto plans of other Ministries. There also has to be a rapid Climate protection program, with the crucial topic being the exit from coal until 2030."
"4060","Above all, the rescue of people's lives is most important. Afterwards, these regions have to get help, quickly and unbureaucratically. This catastrophe is not only the reason for climate change, there are different factors at play here - what we need to do is reform our flood protection programs."
"4061","The increase of extreme weather events shows that the climate is getting warmer. Everything will get more extreme. Not just in the interest of coming generations, but on our own, we finally need to act on climate change. This is about a fundamental change in our course."
"4062","Of course, we need to do more against climate change. I’m happy that Söder is coming around, but I want to remind people: Bavaria, also an affected state, constantly imports dirty energy.  The reason is that Markus Söder refuses to build up other renewable energies than just solar. He might be good at talking about climate change, but he is not believable in his actions."
"4519","We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot."
"4520","We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot."
"4521","There are certainly more pressing matters than some power plays in the small Saarland. Let them deal with it on their own, I want to concentrate on the national campaign."
"4522","Let’s not get derailed - make them change the statutes so Ulrich can stay in the top spot. The delegates democratically voted for him, so we’ll have to accept this result. We can deal with anything further after the election."
"4063","Me and Annalena are a team, and over the next weeks, I want to campaign as such. I’m going to visit her in her district in Potsdam, and I’m going to invite her back home to Schleswig-Holstein, where we’ll embark on a grand tour of Northern Germany."
"4064","<span class='mytooltip'>Winfried Kretschmann<span class='mytooltiptext'>Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg (The Greens, since 2011). As the first Green Minister-President, he’s a leading part of their ecological-conservative wing and is partly known for his eccentric swabian dialect.</span></span>, the only Green Minister-President, has just won his reelection this spring and is very popular, particularly among moderates and conservatives. In order to broaden our appeal and show off competent Green governance, I want to campaign with him in Baden-Württemberg and South Germany in general."
"4065","I’m quite content with our polling numbers in West Germany, but we are still far behind in East Germany. I don’t just want to be perceived as a chancellor of the west - to not get completely pummeled there, I want to focus my visits on the <span class='mytooltip'>New States<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Neue Bundesländer”. Somewhat archaic name for the East German states that joined West Germany in 1990.</span></span>, to make them feel heard and activate traditional non-voters."
"4066","The states of Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have their state elections parallel to our federal elections. To further our standing as a national party, a good result is crucial there. As such, let’s campaign with our top candidates, Bettina Jarasch and Anne Shepley, to show off the strength of our party!"
"4067","I am for the partial opening for vaccinated people. In this nation, freedoms aren't in need of justifications, their restrictions are. If there is no use for these restrictions, they have to go. We should be happy for the people who can now take more walks, who can be more free. We have the vaccine – if you want to be solidaric, you have to vaccinate yourself."
"4068","I am against a vaccination mandate - in a free society, there is a right to become ill. We have to think about the consequences of untested vaccines. Furthermore, we shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead."
"4069","A vaccine mandate has unfortunately become necessary. Freedom's interpretation of the few can not lead to permanent restrictions of the freedoms of the many. We are tired of it. The people in this country are tired. A vaccine mandate can hold herd immunity in Germany high, so that this virus can be defeated."
"4070","Reason and freedom have to prevail, but we have to take the vaccines to the people, not the other way around. We should make it easier for mobile vaccination teams to vaccinate in front of the <span class='mytooltip'>Aldi<span class='mytooltiptext'>German supermarket chain, also active internationally. In the US, they also own <i>Trader Joe’s</i>, funnily enough.</span></span>, the mosque or on the market place. Language- and information barriers have to be reduced more effectively."
"4523","Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore."
"4524","We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however."
"4525","Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage."
"4526","We don’t just want to legalize Cannabis, but also decriminalize small amounts of hard party drugs like XTC, cocaine and amphetamines. The criminalization of drug consumers is a relic from the last century, the ‘right for intoxication’ should be self-evident."
"4071","With the Social Democrats demotivated as they are, we can set our sights onto Söder. I’m gonna emphasize how on climate action, he is all talk and no bite, as well as showing off our commitment to lead a sensible government."
"4072","It’s a good sign for us that the SPD is down in polls - but they’re still a formidable voting block. Their voters should be easiest to win over - let’s target them specifically by emphasizing our socio-economic program and consolidate the center-left around us."
"4073","It looks like Die Linke might struggle to reach the 5%-hurdle. I am clearly the best option for a leftist government - by pressing on this issue, we could keep them out of government and simplify finding a majority. Maybe it’ll even be enough for Green-Red!"
"4074","They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings."
"4075","To finance necessary government spending, taxes on the rich have to be raised. We should reinstate the wealth tax and raise taxes on ecological grounds. However, no money that is earned by the state should be kept, it should be given back to the people. With richer people having a higher ecological footprint, the money gets redistributed to the poor. This is how we can balance the social impact of our reforms in our system."
"4076","Effectively combating climate change is our number one priority, and to finance this, there might have to be certain tax increases on goods like meat or dairy. The wealthy will of course have to bear the highest increase, but everyone will have to contribute more - if we invest in our future, the financial effort will come back manifold."
"4077","We have to readjust our financial politics, to introduce a clause for internal improvements in our debt ceiling. We need a decade of investments to safeguard the climate, freedom and democracy. It is economically sound to abandon the ‘<span class='mytooltip'>Black Zero<span class='mytooltiptext'>“Schwarze Null” in German; economic principle that forbids new debts while promising a balanced budget.</span></span>’ on certain projects, especially considering the current interest rates."
"4078","Climate action doesn’t have to be expensive; particularly policies friendly to innovation, tax rebates for eco-friendly technologies and a higher CO²-price in emission trading can help us combat climate change without high expenditures. Of course, we are proposing more than that, but we’re sure that noticeable tax increases can be avoided."
"4079","The CDU is slowing down at every corner, with topics that would find societal majorities. There are no answers that could come close to the urgency of the tasks ahead. While we definitely advocate for a stricter line on climate change, the party we have the most overlap with is the SPD. In the end, maybe it’ll even be enough for an alliance solely between Green and Red."
"4080","While we of course disavow any cooperation with the AfD, The Left has failed to quell doubts about their ability to govern. They would have to prove, in a particular way, that they are ready, by embracing <span class='mytooltip'>NATO<span class='mytooltiptext'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization; international defensive military alliance between the United States, Canada and multiple European countries, including Germany since 1955. Was the winning party of the Cold War between 1949-1993.</span></span> and the industrial core of this republic. The political task of our time is not in inciting a revolution, but to renew the foundations of trust."
"4081","In our political landscape, we can't keep thinking in binary bloques of Black-Yellow and Red-Green. That political world of the cold war is over, for now. We have to look at different majorities, consisting of three parties – a leftist alliance might be one option for us. If Die Linke proves that they are ready to take responsibility,"
"4082","This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition."
"4527","While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics."
"4528","We want to strike §218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased."
"4529","The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary."
"4530","We need to immediately strike § 218 and $ 219 - instead, the right to free, simple and accessible abortions has to be guaranteed; state-built hospitals should be required to perform the procedure. Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance."
"4083","Berlin is once again pretending like nothing happened. Now, the SPD-led Foreign Ministry and the CDU-led Defense Ministry are constantly deflecting - it’s not true what the government said, that ‘no one could’ve known that the situation would escalate like this’. We need a foreign policy based on value-based realism, not disclaiming responsibility."
"4084","Something that poignantly showcased the lack of responsibility in this debacle is that everyone’s pointing fingers again. No one is in need of such an administration. Our soldiers have done their job, now, we need to do everything we can to bring them and their helpers to safety. We can not let them down, the clock is ticking."
"4085","The task in Afghanistan was to fight terror, in retrospect it's clear that this hasn't happened. We have suffered a military and moral defeat, by leaving behind ten thousand people who would have a right to seek asylum here. By continuing Deportations to Afghanistan, we’d export the death penalty - instead, we need an airlift. No seat in the planes can stay empty."
"4086","We're seeing now that nation building hasn't worked. We need a new foreign policy strategy. We’ve been against this war in Afghanistan from the start - as Europeans, we should be more independent from the Americans and not involve ourselves in imperialist wars."
"4087","Although he seems to lack behind me and Söder, Olaf Scholz is still our main competition for center-left voters. Let’s take the attack to him."
"4088","Söder is my main competitor and retains a lot of goodwill from middle-of-the-road voters. Those are the people we have to win - if we can tarnish his image a bit, we can land on top."
"4089","I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America."
"4090","This format is clearly outdated and does not make for a fair and substantial debate. The media have treated me and my party with constant discrimination. If we want to change up the system, I can not relegate myself to participate in this charade."
"4091","As vice chancellor of the Grand coalition, Scholz epitomizes continuation. The SPD in government has become tired and drained from ideas for the future. Olaf Scholz wants to prolong the habits of the Merkel Era, to depoliticize politics. The Greens stand for a change in our political culture instead."
"4092","Olaf Scholz has a lot to answer for. Despite the warning lights shining for a long time, he failed to deal with the Causa <span class='mytooltip'>Wirecard<span class='mytooltiptext'>Financial company, who ran a bank until 2020, when they shut down due to several billion Euros missing.

While Olaf Scholz was mayor, he secretly met with their chair multiple times.</span></span> banking scandal, as well as making crucial mistakes during the protests against the G20 meeting as mayor of Hamburg."
"4093","His rhetoric on climate change may be well-meaning, but it’s a diversion from the unambitious program of the SPD. They don’t have concepts like we do talking about the social consequences of climate change and have often been slow on climate policy, particularly with the exit from coal. Scholz’s stance on climate action is dishonest."
"4094","Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a pragmatic idealist to rise above the pack."
"4531","Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way."
"4532","Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way."
"4533","Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way."

Maybe we can change that - I want to ask her to appear with us, in an official statement of support. I want to speak to the German youth that brought us where we are today, in some rallies all across Germany’s cities."
"4096","Annalena, despite some minor issues, has been a loyal and effective co-party-leader at my side - it’s only fair to appear with her before this monumental moment. I want to invite her home to my Northern love, Schleswig-Holstein, and appear in a gigantic rally in my native city of Lübeck, the hanseatic capital."
"4097","There will be state elections in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern parallel to the federal elections. To project confidence and strength, I want to appear with Bettina Jarasch in Berlin to help make her the second Green head of state government. This is only the beginning of a Green decade in Europe!"

Let’s ask him to appear with us across South Germany."
"4099","It was a mistake to return to social media, it’s just not good for my temperament and our democratic discourse - I apologize for the remark and delete my accounts, this time for good."
"4100","First, I want to personally apologize to Markus Söder - I should have chosen my words more carefully. Then, I will delete that particular tweet. I can’t go back from social media, but from now on, I want my twitter account to be run by a team that double-checks my tweets."
"4101","People keep taking my words out of context - they might sound bad if you only hear a half-sentence, but overall, I stand by the gist of what I said. Markus Söder cares mostly for power, and uses his convictions primarily to get elected, instead of enacting change."
"4102","I recognize that my tweet was inappropriate and apologize for it. However, I want to to stay there, for purposes of recordkeeping. Censorship can not be the answer in our political discourse - as such, I reserve myself the right to keep writing whatever comes to mind. In this day and age, authenticity is the key to success."
"4103","Markus Söder knows how to score cheap political points. What we need in Germany is moral decency! He sidesteps conflicts, he solves them through the backroom, and does not possess the responsibility to act beyond his own self interests. We need a chancellor with a strong moral compass who isn’t afraid to make politically unpopular decisions."
"4104","On climate change, Markus Söder's record is dishonest. His goals might be sensible - but his measures are unsubstantial. He talks about energy transitions, but doesn't force the build-up of renewable energy. He is for nuclear energy, but woe me waste is stored in Bavaria. Tree-hugging and putting up bee hives does not equate to environmentalism - Söders pretensions clash with reality."
"4105","For the last 16 years, this country has suffered under the failings of the CSU. Markus Söder is emblematic of his party and their governing style. Missing concepts, no answers given; ""back to normality"" of past times instead of looking forward. The Greens stand for change and a politics that goes beyond the Status Quo of <span class='mytooltip'>Seehofer<span class='mytooltiptext'>Horst Seehofer, infamous CSU politician. After stints as Minister of Health (1992-1998) and Minister of Agriculture (2005-2008) he was the Minister-President of Bavaria (2008-2018).

Afterwards, he became Minister of the Interior, mostly continuing his hardline stance.</span></span> and <span class='mytooltip'>Scheuer<span class='mytooltiptext'>Andreas “Andi” Scheuer, controversial CSU politician. As Minister of Transport (2018-2021), he has been the face of several scandals, especially since the failure of the Maut road toll-project (although it was developed by his predecessor Alexander Dobrindt).

"4106","Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a pragmatic idealist to rise above the pack."
"4107","The CDU/CSU has been in government for 16 years, the SPD for 8. A “back to normality” isn’t a desirable outcome - The Greens are designing politics beyond the Status Quo, we aren’t just administrators of standstill. If you vote for a Green chancellorship, you know things will change: we’ll give our society back its confidence and ability to act."
"4108","The situation is serious. We need more engagement with climate change, no politics of hold-up. If we wait any further, it will be expensive - not just environmentally, but also in our wealth and our freedom. The only way forward is ambitious climate action, with renewable energy, a higher price on CO² and technology investments."
"4109","Climate change is a social question. We have a growing inequality in this country that is threatening social peace and our prosperity. We need to change the system and take big corporations to task, with reforms to the debt ceiling and our tax system, as well as concepts to involve low earners in monetary earnings from higher CO²-prices."
"4110","Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. If no one can see how dire the situation really is, we have to take Söder and Scholz to task over their failed administrations. Years and years of standstill, and these just won’t admit that we need change. Someone has to stand up and fight!"
"4535","I stand by my course: 2011, 2018 and 2019 showed us how Germany is fed up with the excuses on climate change. On this issue, our politics has lost all links to reality, because it’s not radical enough. We can not decide against all the knowledge and all the facts about climate change, we need to do something!"
"4536","Stateliness and radicalism aren’t opposites! To really change something, we can’t just swallow the unshackling of global capitalism. We decided on taxing the rich as a party, but we’d be crazy if we didn’t think on a grander scale: instead of arguing about the instruments, we need to ask some critical questions about our economic system!"
"4537","Look, I get it. We need to win societal and parliamentary majorities, so that our country becomes more just. If that means tampering our rhetoric a bit, so be it. It is our job to provide a good offer for the progressive-left center of this country, and while that includes classically leftist answers, it also goes beyond them."
"4538","Ideology isn’t that important to me. I want to answer questions on important issues: what about older people in rural areas, what about the education system, the origins of poverty? We need to listen to different people; environmental protection, social justice and economic prosperity don’t contradict themselves. As a modern party, let us cast a broad net."
"4539","Look, ecological goals don’t just have to be ambitious, they have to be reachable, and affordable. We need to leave the image of a “prohibitory party” behind us - frankly, we have failed in the past with tax-raising-debates - instead we should support sensible, workable policies. Work from within the system - sticking to dogma doesn’t get us anywhere."
"4540","I wanted to broaden our appeal by showing how we’re open to all of society, open to other arguments. That said, our party needs a strongly defined profile, I agree. In the coming campaign, we should increasingly emphasize our environmentalism and center-left attitude."
"4541","Ugh! Yes, no, well… Where's the question?"
"4542","Campaigning is no easy feat. For ten days, I haven't done the dishes. The trash hasn't been put out. The milk is empty. This morning I ate cereal with water, no shit."
"4543","This is sort of a Green tradition, isn't it? Instead of wearing brand new clothing, I am trying to live a mostly sustainable lifestyle, saving on ressources. You could call it a political statement, of sorts."
"4544","For all of us, we have to have tolerance to the counter argument. The auto workers, the coal workers, the conventional agriculturists who fear too much environmentalism, they have a right to bring forth their arguments. And we are well advised to listen to these people, to further the living discourse of democracy."
"4545","So what? Patriotism is a dead concept of the 20th century. We do not have use for it nowadays. We need to think internationally, and finally throw off the shackles of nationalism in Germany, especially in light of what the AfD is saying these days."
"4546","This passage is from a book about “leftist patriotism” I wrote eleven years ago, and every serious politician knows that it’s abhorrently taken out of context. I don’t want to throw this comment back into the spotlight, let them say whatever they want."
"4547","I apologize, these sentences are definitely misleading as to my real position. Today, I wouldn’t write it like that."
"4548","These comments are taken wildly out of context, as anyone would see when looking at the actual passage. I have since come to see how we need to adopt a “leftist patriotism”, to positively relate to our society. Flag and anthem are not courtesy of the right wing populists, leftist parties also have to care about a sense of unity and home."
"4111","Me and Annalena are a team, and over the next weeks, I want to campaign as such. I’m going to visit her in her district in Potsdam, and I’m going to invite her back home to Schleswig-Holstein, where we’ll embark on a grand tour of Northern Germany."
"4112","Annalena, despite some differences between us, has been a loyal and effective co-party-leader at my side - it’s only fair to appear with her before this monumental moment. I want to invite her home to my Northern love, Schleswig-Holstein, and appear in a gigantic rally in my native city of Lübeck, the hanseatic capital."
"4113","They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings."
"4549","Annalena, look: Politics in this country is brutal. Between boulevard-journalists and ruthless conservatives, they’re gonna jump on an ambitious person like you.The people, unfortunately, still seek one thing above all: strength. I’m gonna be frank; <i>a woman can’t win this race.</i> I wish it was different, but it isn’t. If The Greens are to be taken seriously, we have to be honest with ourselves here!"
"4550","I don’t want anything more than to serve this republic as chancellor. But I also don’t want to make this difficult. We can’t afford the perception to throw away our principles of Gender equality just for the sake of power. You’re passionate, determined and ready for sacrifices - you need to do it, Annalena."
"4551","I don’t like to be this cynical, but at the end of the day, it’s a numbers game. My polling looks good, while the people barely know you, Annalena. That’s going to change - but if we want to govern, we need to win, and we can’t take any chances with unknown variables. The people know me, we can work from there. And if I can’t make it, you’ll be popular enough by the next election to take over."
"4552","This isn’t just about the election Annalena, but also about leading a cabinet, a government, a country! In Schleswig-Holstein, I’ve shown how to lead the ecological transformation of our economy forwards. I’ve walked the walk in coalition talks, successfully. You are a capable woman, and you’re of course going to get a post, but this chancellor thing, you need to know your way around the executive."
"4553","In hindsight, maybe we need the visibility after all. I’m going to rejoin Twitter and Facebook and post regular announcements, my appearances in debates and talk shows as well as standard campaign rhetoric. Better too late than not at all, I suppose."
"4554","It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the Greens have a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!"
"4555","Okay, hear me out. This campaign needs a wildcard. This whole time, the Greens are always portrayed as “woke” or something. We could really turn some heads if we show that we’re serious about my pivot on refugees, and there’s only one person in our party who could do that: <span class='mytooltip'>Boris Palmer<span class='mytooltiptext'>Formerly Green Mayor of Tübingen in Baden-Württemberg, since 2007. In his party, he ruffled many feathers not just with his very moderate policies, but in 2015, he came out with a quite conservative take on refugees. In 2023, he left the party. His dad is also known as an eccentric figure, running as an independent in over 250 mayoral races.</span></span>."
