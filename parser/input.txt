Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form this coalition after the election?
F1: Scholz is in a bit of an awkward spot with this attack and can’t give a clear answer. While Habeck doesn’t either, he slips a bit under the radar. Overall, you and Habeck tie the debate, as Scholz’s intrusions into the political center are squashed.
A2: Let’s hit him on his scandals as finance minister. Under his watch, Wirecard collapsed due to fraudulent dealings and lots of people lost their money. We need to poke attention to the police raid on a government office belonging to his ministry - he refuses to take responsibility.
F2: A damaging attack, but he hits back by mentioning the corruption in your party - the CSU is currently associated with a lot of shady deals. The debate gets ugly, you are taken aback, Scholz seemingly can’t remember details of his meetings - in the end, Habeck manages to get out relatively unscathed, with his authentic demeanor winning him the day.
A3: Scholz likes to pretend he’s a moderate, but the program of his party is ideological and leftwing, with unrealistic promises regarding pensions and the minimum wage. It shows that the SPD as a whole is unfit to govern, and a symbol of past days.
F3: You might have had an opening there, but keep in mind, Scholz is still Merkel’s Vice Chancellor. Mentioning his policies makes many people notice the SPD’s agenda once more, and they don’t seem that unpopular. Habeck doesn’t really latch onto the critique, seeing him as not much of a threat - but with his numbers going up in the next few days, it seems both of you underestimated him.
A4:  Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a populist to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the CSU’s record in government. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s unlikely winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q25: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Robert Habeck, chancellor candidate of the Green party. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: Robert Habeck lacks the character to be chancellor. His background is elitist and unrelatable, he refused to wear a tie for this debate and goes on childish rants on twitter while egregiously pushing away his female co-party chair from the top-post.
F1: Your attacks on his character fall flat. You seem scary and imposing, but Habeck is genuinely liked by many people, and most have been clamoring for a more policy-focused debate. Habeck and Scholz condemn your attempts at slandering him and bring it back to the issues. Your performance is criticized sharply.
A2: Everyone on this stage agrees that something has to be done about climate change, but what Mr Habeck and his party want can’t be the solution! Don’t get it wrong: you have to be affluent to vote Green. I am worried that Germany would lose jobs and fall behind under a chancellor Habeck - the CDU/CSU is the true party of the environment.
F2: You gamble that you can win this election on the Greens very own turf. Indeed, you have credibility when talking about the climate - Habeck seems to have difficulties communicating his priorities and gets impatient, while you’re coming off as the voice of reason. Scholz can’t even interject. Surprisingly, voters actually see you as most persuasive.
A3: I’ll attack him for his willingness to govern with the radical Left party. Moderates should be frightened by this prospect, there should be a firewall against Radicals of all stripes, and entertaining a coalition with the Left, as the Greens do, is irresponsible.
F3: That is a weak point for him, but most voters frightened by this prospect are already in your camp. That said, you throw an unwanted leftism on Habecks image. He seems unable to respond properly, and while Scholz has a similar problem, you ignore each other mostly, landing in a tie. The duopoly reasserted itself, at least in the Triell.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a populist to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the CSU’s record in government. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s unlikely winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q26: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the CDU/CSU programs, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: The CSU is the party of climate action - we founded the first environmental protection Ministry in all of Germany, in 1970. We need a new push in talking climate, moving away from coal and towards regenerative energy with a concrete plan of action - I have the economic competence to lead us through this crisis without tempo limits or flight bans.
F1: Habeck criticizes you sharply on the details of your policies, but you do have more executive experience than him - and advocating for climate policies while decrying bans on personal freedoms is a topic you’re comfortable at. Habeck is unable to get a good retort, Scholz doesn’t even register - meanwhile voters like your idealism and optimism, and you come out as the Triells winner.
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason. We’re not in an ideological bubble - politics need to take care of the political center. We need a strong state when talking about security, and a liberal and worldly state when talking about the people’s quality of life. This is the compass to the future.
F2: Your pitch isn’t all bad, considering you are the centrist in this debate - but their arguments about the CSU’s costly proposals of the past, like the Maut, are hard for you to refute. Your generic pitch seems muted in contrast to your opponents visions for change - overall, Scholz manages to walk this tightrope the most competent in his performance.
A3: Bavaria is the most successful state in Germany. We have low unemployment and offer good opportunities. Bavaria works - I will do the same to Germany. My administration will both be a continuity of the efficiency of the Merkel years and a new start.
F3: You are popular in Bavaria, and this pitch helps you in Germany’s 2nd most populous state - but historically, the CSU’s regionalism hasn’t been popular federally. Mentioning Merkel helps, but while Habeck proceeds to poke holes in your presentation of Bavaria, Scholz provides a more impressive defense of Social Democracy in the aura of a statesman.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. We have enough ammunition to show Habecks and Scholz’ incompetence, and I shouldn’t be afraid to use it. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: Your attacks on Green ideology and Scholz’ wirecard dealings are vicious, and your impressive stature makes you seem scary to the average viewer. <i>Die Bild</i> title page reads <i>Terror-Shrek</i> with a picture of you in your carnival-Shrek-costume. In such a climate, Scholz’s calm attitude really caught on, unfortunately.
EQ8: Along with the <i> Triell </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i> Vierkampf </i>. While the Greens have seemingly eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Paul Ziemiak of the CDU (since the CSU is heading the Union ticket through you), debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – unfortunately, this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, counter to prior hopes.
A2: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If the FDP matches or surpasses their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Paul Ziemiak  made a strong case for the Union’s policies and for you as the pragmatic heir to the Merkel era - reaffirming the CDU’s loyalty to you.
A4: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…

Q27: The 26th of September is almost here. Finally, this historically important campaign is coming to an end. Hopefully, your ambitions of becoming Germany’s first Bavarian chancellor can finally come to fruition! In your final lap for this year, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the CDU/CSU has a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F1: Merz dutifully rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show yourself to be a true Christian-Democrat and reassure your right flank. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: Who else but Chancellor Angela Merkel could be the right person? She is a figure larger than life, an electoral juggernaut who has won the last four contests, and I want to show people that I’m the one to build on her legacy.
F2: The outgoing chancellor herself is still popular, and you unite your party while making a believable pitch for centrists - with her last hurrah, she issues you a solid endorsement. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A3: No matter what happens, we have to make sure the right-wing demagogues do not increase their vote shares. I’m worried about the AfD taking first place in some East German states, and direct mandates could go to them: I need to campaign broadly in the New States, with local colleagues like Haseloff and Kretschmer.
F3: The firewall against the right wing is defended in the east, it seems. Your eastern colleagues were among your earliest supporters, and your strict migration policies could prove useful here. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A4: Armin Laschet, party leader of the CDU and my past rival, could help me mobilize voters in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state. I want to bury the hatchet and show how the Union is united to win this election once again!
F4: Laschet is a bit of a hot potato, given his past gaffes. He’s also still somewhat bitter about the way you upstaged him - and can only find enough time for one last event with you, to unite the CDU/CSU. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.

Q7: You and Armin Laschet both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU, in an intra-party competition not seen since 2002. Back then, your predecessor Stoiber won out against Merkel, but lost in the general election. These days, while Laschet has the bully pulpit as leader of the national party, popular opinion polls show you ahead. How do you want to go about settling this?
A1: Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.
F1: It seems like you’ve made some new friends over the last few days. Laschets leadership certainly seemed to have raised some eyebrows: after the state parties of Berlin, Lower Saxony and Baden-Württemberg speak out in your favor, you triumph - the presidium actually finds a narrow majority for you! Laschet is humiliated, and has no choice but to accept you as the Unions candidate: “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.
F2: After days of pressure from some influential people, and seeing the numbers himself, Laschet eventually withdraws his candidacy, with a strong endorsement for you. The way forwards is clear - the chancellor candidacy is yours. However, your aggressive push left a sour taste in the mouth of some colleagues, and you might have to mend some rifts in order to get your campaign going: “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F3: While you present a solid argument, and do get crossparty support, Laschet’s leadership-bonus just seemed too much to overcome after all. He turns out to be the narrow winner in an extremely close contest, and in the end, you concede, deflated. While your respectable showing was still a demonstration of your power, there’s no way around it: you lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F4: The vote is decisive - in the end, your gamble seemed to work flawlessly. With many MP’s fearing to get smothered with Laschet as a candidate, you come out as a clear winner. The CDU leader accepts the vote and steps aside in your favor, giving you the spotlight. While this whole ordeal spent a lot of resources, the party seems to unequivocally unite around your candidacy: “So Germany stays stable”.


Q29: You and Armin Laschet both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU, in an intra-party competition not seen since 2002. Back then, your predecessor Stoiber won out against Merkel, but lost in the general election. These days, while Laschet has the bully pulpit as leader of the national party, popular opinion polls show you ahead. How do you want to go about settling this?
A1: Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.
F1: Unfortunately, the party elites are still on the CDU leader’s side after all. Through the influence of people like Wolfgang Schäuble and Volker Bouffier, Armin Laschet prevails and is declared to be the next chancellor candidate for the Union. You swiftly accept the result, but your audacity damaged your standing in the party. There’s no way around it: You lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A2: During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.
F2: You hammer away - but your pleas fall on deaf ears. While the CSU still supports you, a failure to reach out to the CDU seems to have emboldened Laschet with a stable base of support among the party apparatus. Many of them regard you as an opportunistic paper tiger - without a clearer plan of action, your gambit falters, and you’re firmly asked to support Armin Laschet as the Union candidate. There’s no way around it: you lost to his pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F3: While you present a solid argument, and do get crossparty support, it turns out that your grandstanding has alienated quite a lot MP’s as well. Laschet turns out to be the clear winner in the contest, and you have no choice but to accept a clear result. While you’re still regarded well in Bavaria, there’s no way around it: you lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F4: The vote is close - but in the end, your gamble seems to work. With enough MP’s fearing to get smothered with Laschet as a candidate, you very narrowly come out as the winner. The CDU leader accepts the vote and reluctantly steps aside in your favor, pleading for a united Union. While this whole ordeal spent a lot of resources, the party seems to slowly unite around your candidacy: “So Germany stays stable”.


CDU Course-Correction wenn Mitte
EQ8: Up until now, your campaign has embraced a classical moderate-conservative Christian Democracy, mostly following the center-right party doctrine. Some advisors want you to pivot further left towards the median voter, while others want you to take the AfD’s wind out of their sails. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand by my moderate credentials, I am a proud Christian Democrat. However, we are competing with two left-wing alternatives: in order to win a strong mandate, we need to return to some of my leftwing pivots from the past - they are what brought me success.
F1: A classic electoral tactic. Your pivot back to the left is noted, but muted in effectiveness - your cunning seems to overstay its welcome a bit. Of course, centrists are still enamored with your past stances on climate change, but there are some scathing critiques out there that throw oil on the flames of Habecks and Scholz’ criticisms on your vacillations.
A2: The CDU/CSU are the parties of the center. We have done a great job at governing over the last 16 years, and while we need to move into the future, our future is a Christian-Democratic one. I stand by my course.
F2: Giving nods to each side of the aisle keeps your party united and conflict-free. This is always helpful for the perception of your competency. This gives you more breathing room to campaign in a balanced manner.
A3: Friedrich Merz has tapped into a surprisingly large voter potential in 2018: Merkel-sceptic conservatives. The chancellor has become popular with voters of the other parties - for us, some of her policies are a bit more controversial. On these issues, we definitely need to move rightwards - to provide for a real alternative to the Greens and SPD.
F3: The word “alternative” isn’t lost to your advisors, and your pivot isn’t wholly out of character for you while solidifying your right flank. The fact that you have less competition on this side of the spectrum might have you coming out in first place by default - but there are still grumblings about the distance you’re taking from Merkel.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Rechts
EQ9: Up until now, your campaign has been met with a surprisingly hardline-conservative tone,  seemingly wanting to take the party rightwards, quite evocative of the typical CSU rhetoric during Merkel. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand for what I think is right, but it’s become clear to me we need to defuse ourselves. Let’s reconcile with the CDU and Merkel - so that their supporters won’t defect to the Liberals, or even our opponents.
F1: It’s true that your efforts have radically changed popular opinion around you for the worse, and adjusting your course could prevent some defections- but you risk coming off as a political chameleon without principles. Mending fences with Merkel however should take priority now, you’re still trying to follow in her footsteps.
A2: Yes. I stand for what I believe is right in this country, and it’s clear how we need a change in attitude in Germany to stay competitive. Our standing in the world is decreasing, and we need to work towards improving our country to be the best it can be, because we are patriots.
F2: Patriotism has been a dodgy topic in Germany since the end of the war - but not in Bavaria. When you hold a speech the next day echoing your stance, you energize your supporters, turn some heads in the AfD and reap the approval of both your party and the CDU’s eastern state parties. You sell the line well!
A3: Look - chancellor Merkel is a competent woman who I respect. But the fact of the matter is, her policies have tilted leftwards, both socially and economically. What our country needs in the post-Merkel era are policies more in line with conservative doctrines - the AfD’s success has shown that. If anything, we need to come back to our roots and move this country to the right.
F3: Your biting ideological stance as well as your outright Merkel critiques leak out to the press and dominate the headlines for a few days - this is bad for unity among the Union parties. Some CDU politicians noticeably shoot back - and shrewdly, Habeck and Scholz find conveniently reconciliatory words with the chancellor over the next few days.

A4: While the results in Saxony-Anhalt are definitely praiseworthy, me and my surrogates should focus on attacking my main contender, Robert Habeck. We’re running a national campaign - and directly dealing with our opponent might be better.
F4: You redirect attention on Habeck and his issues - finally a small break in the Greens unlikely surge. That said, you could also push voters away from your own successes, depending on how you frame your attacks.
