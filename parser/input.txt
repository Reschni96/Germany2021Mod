Q999:  Early in the campaign, it looked like you were the woman that could beat Laschet and  deliver a new era not just for The Greens, but also Germany. Now, the situation looks a bit more muddled - you’re still strong, but with Scholz surging, all three major candidates seem to have a realistic shot now. What’s your strategy to rise above the pack?
A1: Despite the SPD catching up, our main opponent in this race is still Laschet and the CDU. I’ll attack him on his gaffes, while emphasizing our moderation - the Greens represent the new center in this country, ready to govern responsibly for every German.
F1: Laschet is already polling historically bad for the CDU. He’s likely already reached his floor - and just by virtue of your party identity, it might be impossible for you to crack it any further. Instead, Scholz uses your strategy to slowly flank you rhetorically from the left: this could help him consolidate traditionally Social Democratic voters.
A2: Up until now, I was more focused on Laschet - with Scholz’s newfound strength, it’s time to change horses. By emphasizing our progressive policies and commitment to a change in Germany’s political consensus, I’ll win back the center-left to our cause.
F2: In and of itself, this doesn’t seem like a bad strategy. That said, due to earlier moderations of yours, this is seen as a politically advantageous pivot, and called out by the media as such. You might recapture some of your base, but be careful you’re not souring on the average voter.
A3: We’ve held our own in this race for a long time. Now, we just have to get across the finish line! Every vote counts, and with a renewed focus on rallies, media visibility and ad campaigns, we’ll pull ahead of the pack.
F3: Focusing on turnout helps your numbers without opening yourself up to counterattacks. It remains to be seen though if this will be enough to net you first place, but flooring the gas pedal seems like a solid way to move forward. Maybe the upcoming debates can conclude this tense race.
A4: Both Scholz and Laschet are old, white men, involved with the GroKo - both stand for the continuation of the status quo. I will heavily lean into my age and gender to present myself as the modern option for change in this country. Only a Green chancellery can reform what needs to be reformed.
F4: While change does lie in the air, the German voters have proven to look kindly on the safe and steady hand of experienced politicians. You do provide a credible option for young people and minorities - but to win this race, you’ll likely have to expand beyond them. Scholz especially seems more favorable to swing voters.

A2: With Scholz’s newfound strength, we need to hone in on his voter base. By emphasizing our progressive policies and commitment to a change in Germany’s political consensus, I’ll win back the center-left to our cause.
F2: As people’s trust in the SPD’s genuineness has faltered ever since the Agenda 2010, the Greens have finally positioned themselves as the definitive alternative for the left. Although taken by Scholz’s gravitas, a lot of younger Social Democrats take a second look at your candidacy - don’t let them down in the final stages of this race.

F3: Focusing on turnout helps your numbers without opening yourself up to counterattacks. Your good favorability numbers pay off, as your rallies become large media events, outnumbering the attendants of your two opponents. Perhaps this wasn’t such a bad idea!

A3: We’ve held our own in this race for a long time. Now, we just have to get across the finish line! Every vote counts, and with a renewed focus on rallies, media visibility and ad campaigns, we’ll pull ahead of the pack.
F3: Your new focus isn’t bad, but as attacks from Laschet, and even a few sideswipes from Scholz’s camp follow, your passivity does little to redefine the race. Instead, the ascendant SPD and a reorganized CDU campaign largely take over the headlines, in what seems to become another duel between the two giants.

F4: With you as a popular figurehead of this new movement, you seem to drive the political discourse forward. While there’s a significant part of the population voting on competence instead of rabble-rousing, your message seems genuinely inspiring in contrast to your drab opponents.

F4: Unfortunately, while many people want change, the gravitas of your opponents wins out. To be blunt, many people just don’t trust you to lead this country, ever since your likeability numbers have dropped into toxicity.
