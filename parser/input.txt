CDU-Laschet

Q1: January 2021: The CDU is in a state of upheaval following Merkel's announcement of retirement. <br>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was her handpicked successor, but after she faltered, the party is looking for a new leader. After passing up a bid in the former contest in 2018, you feel like now is the time to strike - how do you want to convince the delegates to vote for you instead of Norbert Röttgen or your chief rival, political comeback-kid Friedrich Merz?
A1: I am the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state in Germany. The CDU is the party of competence - and none of my opponents has held a political office in the last few years. I will bring my expertise in modern governance to the national level.
F1: Although you eschew ideology, competence is a great argument and the reason why you were drafted in the first place. Those who backed Kramp-Karrenbauer before now look to you. With no majority on the first ballot, you win against Merz on the second ballot.
A2: Out of the three candidates nominated, I am the only one who has actually won an election and in a former SPD-stronghold nonetheless, in a strong black-yellow coalition. It is crucial that we win the Bundestagswahl this fall, and I am the right man to do it!
F2: Both Merz and Röttgen have been out of politics for a bit and haven’t proven their electability. With the CDU eager for a continuation of their dominance and your record showing that you can deliver, you almost clinch the nomination on the first ballot and easily win the second.
A3: I am more conservative than Röttgen and more liberal than Merz. By positioning myself between those two, I can split them apart and draw votes from whoever is knocked out on the first ballot - I’ll then win the second ballot by default.
F3: Elections are won in the center! While the party is not all that enthusiastic about you, you really do win on the second ballot against Merz, with Röttgen's endorsement. Be sure to talk some straight talk though, lest your base asks for a stronger man to become chancellor…
A4: The party officials are largely behind me. They should push for me behind closed doors to make sure I win this contest. I will already focus on convincing swing voters for the election.
F4: Remember Merkel’s poster from 2017: <i>The big whole starts with an ear for the smaller things</i>. While you’re perceived as arrogant and complacent, Friedrich Merz rises from the ashes as a “man of the people”. He beats you narrowly, and you can only watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor this fall.

Q2: Congratulations, you are now the 12th party leader of the Christian Democratic Union! You are not the official chancellor candidate of the Union of CDU and CSU yet, but hopefully, that will just be a formality. In your acceptance speech at the convention, what will be your emphasis?
A1: I want to continue the legacy of the Merkel-era as much as possible. Her sixteen years of chancellorship were outstanding, and her course of the center was and is the right one.  I want to become a chancellor in continuity to Angela Merkel and her accomplishments.
F1: Adenauer's spirit praises you: “No experiments!” Angela Merkel is a popular chancellor and holds significant respect for middle-of-the-road voters. However, some perceive a certain stagnation in government in the last few years. Be sure to provide some vision for the future, or you won’t win anyone under the age of 50. 
A2: The CDU is the party for the middle of society. I will continue moving the party into the future, with a moderate and pragmatic course on the issues of the day. We have to do everything that the democratic center wins this election, and I disavow any cooperation with the AfD!
F2: Right-wing culture warriors have already bled to the AfD, but your course does not convince them to come back. To be fair though, you might not need them if you convince enough non-ideological voters of the need for stability - a big electoral prize in Germany. 
A3: The strong showing of Merz has shown that the right wing of the party has too often been ignored by Merkel. Under my leadership, we will bring the party back on a more conservative path. The most important tenet for us is the Christian conception of man, and we need a clearer profile on economic policies.
F3: After the leadership contest, mainstream media wonders why you’re caving so much. That said, taking back frustrated culture warriors might be good to keep the extreme right small, and your base certainly is excited. Be careful with your rhetoric though - lest you imitate them too much for the average voter. 
A4: While I will praise Merkel for her outstanding career, we need to acknowledge the challenges of the 21st century: particularly climate change. It is important that we don’t leave this topic to other parties, but present solutions of our own, that go beyond what we are doing now. 
F4: “Laschets left-wing pivot”, the headline of <i>Der Spiegel </i> reads. That’s not necessarily meant as an insult - many outsiders tentatively praise your new outlook. It’s insiders though who worry that you’ve gone woke, especially in your sister party, the CSU. The AfD salivates at you leaving your right wing open to attacks.

Q3: March 2021: Since the sudden outbreak in early 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the Corona-Virus, has shaped the lives of people in Germany and across the world. Now that the winter is over, a lot of people are demanding an end to the harsh lockdowns. As Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, you could chart a new course for your government. What is your stance on this?
A1: While the lockdowns were the right thing to do, now that the winter is over and we have started to vaccinate people, it is time to return to normalcy. North Rhine-Westphalia will open up quickly.
F1: Your approach backfires. As soon as the climate warms, cases are surging again, and you face harsh critiques for your carelessness. Political opponents from your left criticize you sharply, as does famous virologist Christian Drosten.
A2: The situation is still very volatile and it is better to be cautious than reckless. We should keep the lockdowns for the foreseeable future, and only open up on strict criteria.
F2: At first, people are grumbling, but when cases start to surge again in the spring, this looks like a good call. Not all are satisfied though - some view prolonged lockdowns as unconstitutional, especially in East Germany.
A3: While I’m all for opening up, we should keep an eye on the number of infected people and have a bridge lockdown during Easter if the case numbers become too high.
F3: You manage the crisis well enough, but your proposals seem confusing and irritating to the average voter. You perceive a hit in your favorability for your lack of vision and communication.
A4: This is a decision that the federal government and the states have to make together. I will wait and see what this process achieves and go with the majority opinion.
F4: People expect more leadership from a supposed future chancellor. While the measures are effective at keeping Covid at bay, and local outlets do give credit, this allows other political actors to outshine you - both inside and outside your party.

Q4: You’ve been invited to a talk show to talk about tax policy. Another topic is the  “Schwarze Null”, and its mandate of a debt-free balanced budget. The left and left-of-center seeks more investments, paid for by taxing the rich, while the FDP seeks widespread tax reductions. How do you want to frame your position?
A1: Under no circumstances will we raise taxes, but we don’t want to dramatically lower them either. We will phase out the extra tax of the Soli and try to reduce the burden on small and medium-income earners while always keeping the budget balanced, in keeping with the “Schwarze Null”.
F1: This is your expected position, and your colleague, former Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Schwarze Null”, thanks you in private. These proposals aren’t exactly unpopular, but a visionary you are not.
A2: The Covid crisis has left a massive hole in our budget that we have to plug somehow. We have to be measured, but a tax increase will likely be unavoidable to avoid harsh debts that can hurt our economy even further.
F2: A brutally honest answer, but honesty isn’t always well received, as the FDP and AfD make hay from disappointed market liberals. Leftists aren’t going to vote for you on that promise either. You should probably tread more lightly with unpopular policies this close to the election, much as your heart might be in the right place. 
A3: Taxes for private households should stay where they are or even be lowered by phasing out the Soli. More importantly, corporate taxes should be lowered to unleash the full economic potential of this country. As little State as necessary, as much market as possible.
F3: A small pivot for you, but an inspiring message to campaign on - classic Christian-Democratic economics. However, your colleague, Former Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Schwarze Null”, fears more state debt without running a tighter fiscal ship.
A4: To stimulate the economy after the Covid crisis, taxes have to be lowered across the board for both private households and corporations. We also have to streamline tax bureaucracy, and consider new solutions, in the form of flat tax proposals for example.
F4: It’s not a bad line persé, but to many, you sound more like a caricature of the FDP or Friedrich Merz - and even he criticized flat tax proposals in the early 2000’s. This is kind of a flip-flop and you’re just not the right person to sell this position in this day and age. Even party insiders deride you as naive behind closed doors. 

Q5: Shook to your core, you read the headline of the 11/2021 issue of<i> Der Spiegel</i>: <br>” <i>‘Schwarzer Filz’ - Mask deals, venality, failure in crisis: the deep fall of the Union. </i> “<br>They reveal how several CDU/CSU MPs are implicated as part of a corrupt scheme to sell overpriced medical masks to government organizations, in order to profit from the crisis. Journalists run in your door, asking for a comment on the first crisis of your party leadership.
A1: I was as shocked as everyone else when I found out about this! The parliamentary immunity of these MPs should promptly be removed so they can be properly investigated. Corruption has no place in the CDU/CSU!
F1: Some wonder if corruption really has no place in your party, seeing how deep the connections lay, but the media praises you for your strong and steadfast response. Some in your party are nervous about how fast you were to drop your colleagues just like that.
A2: Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened.
F2: Journalists keep heckling you for more of a comment - this comes off as very suspicious, especially as more and more of these corrupt dealings come to light. When even your son is implicated, you seem to fail your first big challenge as party leader.
A3: This is nothing but a political hit job by a left-wing magazine in an election year. I’m sure further investigations will prove the innocence of these MPs.
F3: Look, <i>Der Spiegel </i>isn’t The Jacobin. Nobody is buying this, as the report is well sourced and new details come out almost every day. This makes you seem very out of touch with the public mood; some right-wingers on social media praise you, but the AfD seeks to profit from government corruption.
A4: Let us be pragmatic. Two of our MPs may have indeed shown low moral inhibitions, but we shouldn’t judge the whole party based on the actions of two people. We support this investigation as much as anyone else, these are individual black sheep.
F4: At first, your argument seems solid, with your base cheering you on - but in time, more and more people, including your own son, are implicated in similar dealings, as your line of defense weakens. Better change the subject.

Q6: April 2021: Minister of Finance and current Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been declared chancellor candidate by the SPD last year already and there are rumors the Green party is about to nominate either Annalena Baerbock or Robert Habeck next. Do you want to formally declare your candidacy before they do?
A1: This seems like a good time to declare my candidacy, yes. Though before I declare, I will make a courtesy call to Markus Söder, the party leader of our sister party, the CSU, to make sure he won’t oppose me.
F1: To your surprise, man of power Markus Söder tells you he wants to become the candidate of the Union as well. You both make your intentions public on the same day - and his favorability seems better than yours. This might become ugly…
A2: Yes, I will inform the upper party echelons and formally announce this during a press conference in my home state. There is no time to lose! It’s time for the campaign to get going.
F2: Journalists are surprised by what seems like a hasty announcement, but this move was expected at some point. Surprisingly, Markus Söder, leader of the CSU, declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union as well, some days later. At least it looks like you have a small headstart.
A3: You know, it might be better to wait this out a bit longer - just biding our time and consolidating our party influence. I can declare after whatever announcement the Green party makes to get them out of the limelight.
F3: This backfires when the leader of your sister party and enjoyer of the spotlight Markus Söder declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union the next day after. You’re taken by surprise and quickly follow suit, but this doesn’t make you look good, especially since Söder is quite popular.

Q7: Söders ambitions were always clear, but this is shaping out to be a blatant confrontation. <br>You and Söder both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU. You have some bully pulpit at your side - although polling shows Söder to be more popular than you. How do you want to decide this contest?
A1: It wasn’t an easy decision. I thought about this long and hard, but I want to retract my candidacy. Söder is a competent man, has better polling numbers, many of our party members support him and I’m quite happy here serving as Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia.
F1: Söder is both surprised and grateful. Your retreat immediately makes the headlines, but not in a bad way - your move is called a humble, but necessary one, as with his polling numbers, he vows to puts up a hell of a fight for the election, “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: Let’s call every big name in the party, curry every favour, maybe we can even get Merkel herself to weigh in. I can’t have this decided by vote and risk being humiliated, I want this decided by the party elites now.
F2: Tense days pass. Finally, respected party eminence Wolfgang Schäuble intervenes on your behalf. With his help, you convince party leadership to declare you as their candidate. Söder is pissed though, and you stand there looking like a coward. Now the pressure is on you to deliver on your slogan: “Making Germany Together”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F3: While this is true, a lot of people in the CDU also preferred Söder, taken by his machismo and apparent electability. In somewhat of an upset, you narrowly lose the vote and have to have to cheer on Söder for the rest of the campaign. Your career is probably in jeopardy, but he sure puts up a hell of a fight on the campaign trail.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F4: While the vote is closer than you’d like, in the end, you come out victorious and vindicated. Söder accepts the outcome and both of you move on to focus on the upcoming campaign. This whole ordeal rankled some party members though, and your polling is lower than Söders hypotheticals. Now, let’s prove them wrong, “Making Germany Together”!

Q8: Wow, that was a close one! First, let’s take a breath. <br>Now, you have finally jumped the last hurdle and formally became the chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. Congratulations! What talking point do you want to hit on at the press conference?
A1: First and foremost, I want to thank Markus Söder for accepting this outcome. We have to be united as a party to win this fall. Apart from that, I will hit my usual talking points, about stability, pragmatism, praising Merkel and acting on our values.
F1: Party unity is always necessary, and being nice to Söder will help you among his supporters. Your speech comes to no surprise and doesn’t rock the boat, but it serves as a good rallying cry for anyone who might vote for the Christian Democrats.
A2: This closer-than-expected contest has convinced me that I need to change my attitude on some topics. I’ll focus on how a harsh line on the pandemic and on climate change is of critical importance, how we need strong leadership in these trying times and new ideas to move forward, to build on Angela Merkel's successes.
F2: Trying to capitalize on the winds of change, are we? It’s obvious to onlookers that you’re trying to take a page from Markus Söder’s playbook, but he did seem to hit a nerve. Let’s hope emulating him reaps you similar poll numbers.
A3: I will give a largely non-political speech. We need to focus on the importance of cohesion and trust in our society, to come together as one in the wake of this crisis, not letting our different views divide us, and the values of honest work. I want to bring up the anecdote about my father, who was a miner. A statesman is what we need right now.
F3: A bit meandering, but admirable sentiments in these difficult times. Anyone could have given this speech, but casting a broad net is what the Union wants. Don’t stretch it too thin though - pundits keep debating on what your actual government would look like. 
A4: The success of the AfD showed us that this country is in dire need of change and a new direction, away from the Status Quo. I will promise to modernize Germany while letting our conservative values guide us in this progress. A new Germany, responsible and sensible.
F4: You’re right, many people demand change - but you certainly weren’t elected on this premise. The CDU has been in government for almost 16 years now, and Merkel’s allies are lukewarm about your newfound criticism of the Germany she has shaped so thoroughly. It’s doubtful how effective this argument can be from your mouth. 

Q9: The Green party has, for the first time in its history, nominated a chancellor candidate, Annalena Baerbock. In a development few would have expected four years ago, she appears to be your main contender, even polling ahead of you sometimes, while Olaf Scholz of the SPD is far behind in third place. What’s your strategy regarding your two opponents?
A1: The Green party is always surging a few months before elections and comes crashing down in time, just like in 2011 after Fukushima. I’m not too worried - we should still focus more on competing with the SPD, our traditional opponent.
F1: Maybe you’re onto something, after all, the duopoly of CDU and SPD has held for over 70 years - but dismissing Baerbock seems foolish right now, considering the Greens currently poll much higher than at any point in their history. Perhaps you know something the media does not?
A2: I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to take the climate more seriously. Let’s unveil some of our own environmental policies to stop their momentum and defuse some of their criticisms.
F2: By and large, voters trust the Green party more on these issues, but providing concrete answers helps clarify the record and modernize your image. Söder has tried this before to much praise - just beware of your climate-suspicious rural base. They still need a reason to vote for you over radical alternatives.
A3: Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for center-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and just attack them moderately where we can.
F3: You’re probably right, but don’t get complacent - you are vying for swing voters with both parties and have lost some ground yourself recently. By keeping conservatives and Merkel-approvers together, you can come up on top by default. You will probably need one of those parties in your coalition though.
A4: Actually, this is a bit ridiculous and reminds me of the publicity stunt the FDP pulled in 2002 when they nominated Guido Westerwelle as chancellor candidate. Let’s mock them for their hubris and don’t refer to Baerbock as a legitimate chancellor candidate.
F4: This seems very petty, somewhat desperate, even sexist, seeing how Baerbock is the only woman polling that high right now - the media isn’t slow to call you out on this. Also, you might need the Greens as a coalition partner later on, making fun of them like this won’t make you any friends.

Q10: Germany’s relationship with Russia has been a complicated one since the end of the Second World War, but even more so since Putin’s occupation of Crimea in 2014. Michael Kretschmer, your party colleague and Minister-President of Saxony, has recently traveled to Moscow and has been criticized for that visit. What’s your stance on current policies regarding Germany’s relationship with Russia and Putin?
A1: It is important that we don’t demonize Putin and keep our dialogue open. I’m critical of many things the Russian leadership has done, but overall, we should strive to cooperate with them, as we do on the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F1: You are disparagingly called a <i>Putinversteher</i> by some, although especially in East Germany, this sentiment is popular. Seeing as how the CDU is traditionally more hawkish, some perceive a certain paradigm shift. Hopefully you have the political acumen to win over Russia as a future partner.
A2: I’ve been more lenient in the past, but enough is enough. I will join in with the criticism against Kretschmer and call for a tougher stance towards Putin. Maybe we should only open the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline if we get some concessions from Russia.
F2: Considering your past statements, this is a bit of a flip-flop and might be perceived as conflict-happy. With public opinion on this matter divided, you have cast your dies very clearly. Polish politicians praise you on social media -  let’s hope you can unite the rest of Europe as chancellor on this topic.
A3: Kretschmer is completely right, we have to talk more with Russia, not less. I’m all in favor of more dialogue and stronger economic ties with Russia. Besides, it’s not like the USA has never done anything wrong.
F3: For most, this comes off as too lenient towards Russia. Criticizing the transatlantic partnership isn’t really in line with your party and longtime americanophile Angela Merkel refuses to comment. Maybe Gerhard Schröder agrees with you on principle, but don’t expect any SPD voters to cross over because of this.
A4: This whole thing is overblown, this trip was mostly for cultural exchange. I don’t have much to say about this. We stand on our commitment to Nato.
F4: As much as you might want to, this issue isn’t going away, and you haven’t really pleased anyone with this statement. Your commitment to Nato comes to no surprise and doesn’t register. Don’t be shy to show more backbone!

EQ1: You’re invited to a talk show about immigration and refugees. Although tempers have cooled a bit since 2015, the discussion around Merkel's decision to welcome the refugees 6 years ago is still relevant - particularly for the AfD, who got driven into parliament on this issue in 2017. Germany is still a popular destination for many foreigners seeking a better life, yet the nation does not seem prepared for this. What stance do you take in this debate?
A1: I supported Merkel's decision at the time, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency Frontex.
F1: This is a sensible answer to many. Merkel's decision was popular with centrists, and you satisfy your base by promising a stricter course in the future. Of course, the left and right are equally pearl clutching at your comments.
A2: There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.
F2: A pragmatic answer - immigration is an often suggested solution to numerous problems, but your CSU colleagues and many in your voter base are wary of unintegrated people straining the social safety net. There’s also the issue of college degrees from Third World countries not being accepted, so this would have to be dealt with. 
A3: Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We’re saying: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean and a Marshall Plan for Africa.
F3: It’s good to support Merkel, and certain politicians, like Foreign Development Minister Gerd Müller are happy about your initiative. The rest of your party is split - the majority even seems quite wary of more refugees, warning you about another 2015 with your rhetoric - and the AfD seems quite welcoming for some of these critics. 
A4: On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - 2015 can’t repeat itself.
F4: Harsh words that are controversially discussed - there does seem to be a right-wing-pivot in the CDU, at least on this issue. You do get the attention of a few former conservatives that are now in the AfD’s camp: if you can prove that you’re serious, they might come back home. 

Q11: May 2021: A bombshell has rocked the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin has already gone to work on making the law stricter. What is your opinion on this issue?
A1: This was a bad decision by the court. The Climate Protection Act already went far enough and I’m not in favor of hurting the economy with a stricter climate policy. We need to look out for our workers and industry, fear is not the answer.
F1: This is out of touch with the country’s mood. You give a great sound bite for Green criticism, and make some waves in the media. Even your party can read the room, and the new law must comply with the decision either way. At least the AfD doesn’t have anything to gripe about you on this. 
A2: It is important that we quickly implement the new law. I’m especially in favor of a price for CO<sub>2</sub> that is formed by market forces. We have to make sure that everyone can keep affording their energy bills, though, and we need to use this opportunity to create new jobs.
F2: You strike a good balance between acknowledging the need to do more and taking the worries of many citizens seriously. This mix of policies plays well in less affluent regions while not aggravating environmentalists.
A3: We have to become carbon neutral long before 2050. I’m sure the government under Merkel will come up with a sensible solution, which I will continue as chancellor.
F3: A fairly vague answer. You tie yourself to Merkel, but others make more waves with your passivity - the SPD takes this decision as a vindication for its lobbying for stronger climate protections within the coalition.
A4: With the decision by the court, we now have a great opportunity for an ambitious new Climate Protection Act. I advocate for Germany to be carbon neutral by 2040 and to accelerate the transition to renewable energies. We simply can’t wait anymore.
F4: Potential Green voters like this approach - the new CDU really seems to take the climate more seriously. Coalition talks with the Greens now ought to be easier. Your own base is unnerved though; what about all the jobs in traditional industry, and what about the energy prices? 


Links wenn (Center-Right)>2. Rechts wenn (Right-Center)>1 Sonst Mittig
CDU Course-Correction wenn Links
EQ2: Up until now, your campaign has been dominated by a very centrist attitude, tilting center-left even. To many, this seems evocative of Angela Merkel, but some party cadres, particularly around Friedrich Merz, are worried about their core values. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: Yes, I do. Angela Merkel is a highly esteemed stateswoman and one of the best chancellors this country ever had - although to modernize our party, we have to recalibrate our course on climate change and protecting our social safety net. The CDU is an innovative party of the 21st century, and I will not let myself get intimidated by right-wing demagogues.
F1: Reasonable - Merkel is popular, some say it’s because of her willingness to evolve leftwards. The new CDU does get some looks from potential SPD voters and even rural Greens - but the right wing of your party isn’t pleased at all. Your slight against them might make some of them sit it out, or even consider more radical options.
A2: I do not think in ideological categories, I’m simply standing for what I think is good for Germany. The CDU is the party of good governance - not radicalism, neither leftist nor rightist.
F2: The German people like pragmatism. You could tie yourself further to Merkel, but your authentic attempts to show off a modern Christian Democracy raise your personal favorability. Just keep your base in mind - they do need some red meat from time to time.
A3: I wanted to begin this campaign by bringing us all together - now we can try to tilt the discourse rightwards, taking Merkel supporters with us while framing our conservative positions as more reasonable.
F3: Your shrewd attempt has mixed results. A certain pivot rightwards is noted by pundits, and it makes you look a bit cowardly, scared of the AfD - but it could also raise enthusiasm for you among party activists.

Q12: More and more people are receiving a Covid vaccine, though not everyone has been granted access yet. Older people and those in critical professions are starting to get the shot, while some who are younger are frustrated to wait. Do you have a comment on how to move forward with the vaccination campaign?
A1: We need to open up quickly for vaccinated people. A return to normalcy has never been so close, and we all had more than enough of lockdowns - not every measure might still be proportionate. Vaccinated people have less risk and thus should receive more benefits.
F1: While this stance has its appeals, the majority of people who haven’t had a chance to get vaccinated yet aren’t thrilled - mostly younger voters. Also, some think this might cause a wedge in society, with a certain air of segregation. It is a good compromise if you think opening up is necessary, though.
A2: We are currently in a very critical phase of the pandemic, a phase in which cohesion could easily be endangered. Vaccinated people should be exempt from some restrictions, but let’s not go overboard. We need to move forward together and be patient until science tells us that it’s safe.
F2: This is a bit more on the cautious side, but overall, quite well received by many corners of society. Some, especially from within FDP and AfD, gripe about ongoing lockdowns - I guess you can’t always make everyone happy. This should definitely keep Covid under control though.
A3: It’s important that as many people as possible get vaccinated as quickly as possible so we can overcome this crisis, but that’s not what’s happening. Maybe we should question the prioritization system we have right now.
F3: Some younger folk listen, but with the limited supply of vaccines available, there are not enough doses to vaccinate everyone who wants it. Questioning the prioritization system seems unfair to many older folks in your camp.
A4: The vaccine seems helpful now, but we haven’t had a chance to study its side effects yet. We should be mindful of our bodily health and not be too quick in our judgment - I advocate for a slowdown of the vaccination campaign until we have more information.
F4: This position places you far outside the mainstream - Covid-expert Christian Drosten immediately goes on TV to criticize you, and many of your colleagues start to keep their distance from you. A certain part of the population calls you their hero, but they’re not a big electoral prize - prepare for a drop in the polls.

Q13: You have been invited to give a speech about German foreign and defense policy. Members of the Bundeswehr stand in the crowd: they eagerly listen to what direction you want Germany to take on the world stage. Which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: For years and years, we have consistently missed the NATO aim to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. I strongly reaffirm our commitment to NATO and this goal! The West has to be united against potential threats.
F1: The audience cheers you on, as spending more on defense is always popular in more conservative circles, as is a commitment to the alliance. Not every potential voter is convinced of this, though - the anxiety about war runs deep in Germany’s collective memory.
A2: While I strongly reaffirm our support of a united Alliance and strong defense, I specifically want to call out Annalena Baerbock. She lacks a clear commitment to NATO, which is not appropriate for a chancellor.
F2: With how strong the Green Party has been in the polls lately, hitting on them seems like a good strategy. This is a usual attack against them, but even though they seem to move right on defense, it still seems to hit the spot after some of Baerbocks statements on the 2%-goal.
A3: I want to praise the work we’ve done so far and believe we are in a good spot. While I strongly reaffirm my commitment to NATO, we don’t need to spend more on defense than we do right now; we need to combat waste first and foremost.
F3: This does little to differentiate you from other parties and is softer on defense than the usual position of your party. It does give you some minor wiggle room on fiscal and foreign policy - be sure to make use of it after the election.
A4: NATO is a relic of the cold war. We should stay a member for now, but we should also try to find avenues for cooperating with other nations, keep reaffirming our neutrality, and open up new dialogues with Russia or China.  
F4: The crowd is silent, some cough in embarrassment. Maybe a few fringe voters will like this statement - everyone else is horrified, especially your party colleagues. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who got the position of Minister of Defence during her stint as party leader, openly disagrees with your statement.

EQ3: One salient issue is the topic of pensions, particularly in light of Germany's changing demographics. Currently, pensions are distributed from a fund financed by the current working populace. However, because the number of retirees seems to grow faster than the workforce, the system is thought to be unsustainable. How do you want to address this problem?
A1: The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.
F1: This is a good conservative answer that will motivate your base. <br> This has been the Union's line since its founding, and it does appeal to your older base as well as to young families. That said, this still seems naively passive to some. People also notice how this old-school approach is shared with the AfD.
A2: A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.
F2: An interesting twist that modernizes your image – but keep in mind, while Merkel did show a lot of lenience to immigrants and refugees, many in your party are worried about economic refugees and integration policies straining the social and fiscal health of the nation. Safe to say, the AfD immediately starts churning its fear mongering social media machine.
A3: It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.
F3: Surprisingly leftist! Although the Social Market Economy is a CDU invention, your answer is taken as an indirect critique of Merkel. Many of your colleagues take you aside in concern, particularly on your plans to finance this, and experts actually recommend raising the retirement age. Hopefully this can fortify your older base and make unexpected inroads.
A4: We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.
F4: This is a broad attractive mix of moderate policies that show your engagement with the topic and unites your base. You avoid criticizing Merkel and offer some innovative solutions – though many fear another raise of the retirement age. To your opponents, this doesn't go far enough, of course.



Q14: June 2021: Things look to be on somewhat of an upswing. Baerbock seems to falter to some negative headlines, and on top, the CDU was the big winner at the provincial elections in Saxony-Anhalt, with Minister-President Reiner Haseloff’s popularity being credited. What’s your reaction to this information?
A1: I want to congratulate Haseloff for his strong performance. It shows that the citizens still trust the CDU to be the best governing party, and we want to emulate his strategy on a national scale.
F1: While his performance was impressive, his strategy was partially built on his incumbency as a “Landesvater”. Still, it might not be a bad message to campaign on good governance, as you’re quite popular in NRW yourself. “For a Germany, in which we live well and gladly”, as Merkel advertised 4 years ago.
A2: Haseloff performed very well, but I want to emphasize that the AfD lost votes. When we keep appealing and listening to all people, without prejudice, we can win them back for the democratic parties.
F2: The need to win back AfD voters is definitely something that most parties can agree on - hopefully, your focus on this front can actually yield electoral success. It’s unlikely they’ll exit the parliament, but maybe Haseloff has some good advice.
A3: This was a very strong performance. To show my gratitude, I will make an extra trip to Saxony-Anhalt and campaign with him for some nice pictures.
F3: Haseloff is glad to campaign with you. You definitely show your appreciation of Saxony-Anhalt, and East Germany notices. On your end, you enjoy some local <i> Rotkäppchen</i>-wine and <i>Baumkuchen</i> as well as an inter-denominational visit to Martin Luther's hometown, the Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

EQ4: With the campaign developing, Annalena Baerbock has caught criticism from the media. She’s dealing with numerous scandals: allegations of plagiarism in her book, an inconsistent CV, as well as failing to report extraparliamentary earnings on time. With her seemingly being your main opponent, how do you want to capitalize on this?
A1: We should definitely hit her on these topics. This is unprofessional behavior that should not happen in the chancellery. These concerns about her integrity have to be addressed.
F1: The plethora of scandals she encounters certainly works to her disadvantage- but some time after, it comes out how you yourself have plagiarized and how your own CV is inconsistent. This is embarrassing, and during all the sniping and back-and-forths, Olaf Scholz is recently seen more often with his signature “smurfy grin”.
A2: Not only that - did you notice how she used the N-Word in that interview, and had to be censored out? Such mistakes of communication are unacceptable for a chancellor, and the problematic nature of this faux pas should shed doubt on her character.
F2:  You’re overreaching here. She was criticized for this, but not only did she apologize before the interview came out, it’s clear she said it in an antiracist context. To most people in Germany, this isn’t a big deal, and your attacks seem unnecessarily desperate.
A3: People can make their own decisions about this, what I want to talk about is substance. Her policies are expensive for the middle class and ineffective, and she does not have the necessary experience to be chancellor. She talks - I act.
F3: This works to rally up the base and makes a good pitch for your party - if this can really pierce through to the voter is unclear. Either way, people still notice Baerbocks misgivings, and they indeed don’t shed a good light on her.
A4: People aren’t clamoring for my comments here, they will be judged on their own. I want to stay positive and talk about the successes I will bring to Germany.
F4: People appreciate your restraint - you shed any danger of being accused of sexism while Baerbocks favorability slips on its own. However, the scandals don’t stay in the headlines for much longer, and the campaign keeps going as normal. 

Q15: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbors, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. With all parties unveiling plans to rectify this, what focus do you want to lay?
A1: The pandemic has shown how ill-prepared our schools are. We need to continue improving digital infrastructure in education, through more training, technical assets and a national educational platform. That is what the CDU/CSU has worked on, and will continue doing.
F1: You’re right that this is important, and it’s in line with the current government's strategy - but many blame your party for the current misery. Maybe it’s best to not continue the last 16 years - some say these measures don’t go far enough, especially the FDP, who have staked out digitalization as their favorite topic.
A2: Actually, we don’t have much to gain by talking about this topic - many voters see us as responsible for the current situation. Let’s downplay it as much as we can and focus on issues where we are seen as more competent, like matters of security or debt.
F2: A fatalistic approach, but a reasonable one. Young voters are disappointed by your lack of a proper position, but better not to fan the flames lest you burn yourself, right? Some Union officials are a bit peeved that you aren’t talking about their purported successes, but even they can read the numbers.
A3: We definitely need to modernize the digital infrastructure of Germany, especially in the public sector. Administrative matters have to be more accessible to citizens, we need to digitize all internal processes and cut down on bureaucracy.
F3: An expected answer, not a bad one - improving the accessibility of Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is popular. However, most parties call for something like this, and this framing of your platform does not generate a lot of attention. The FDP meanwhile drives their strategy on this issue in particular.
A4: Digitalization is a key issue - we need a digital transformation offensive. I want to especially emphasize that we will accomplish a nationwide 5G mobile network by 2025 and provide 15 billion Euros for Gigabit-networks. To that end, we will also establish a Ministry of Digital Innovation and Transformation.
F4: The 5G network is a strong promise that will especially help you in less urban areas, where even 4G coverage can be seen as luxurious in some corners. Your idea of a new Ministry for this topic shows your dedication, but some criticize that digitalization is a cross-sectional task that shouldn't be centralized.

EQ5: One of the more salient issues in the current political landscape across the western world is the question of rents, particularly for younger voters. Most economic and educational opportunities increasingly lie in the big cities of the country - where rent is constantly increasing, to the point where it becomes a serious political question. What is your answer to the housing question?
A1: We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.
F1: A mainstream market-focused answer that will resonate with dozens of families dreaming of an ‘Eigenheim’, particularly in rural regions - the land for new buildings can get quite sparse in the cities. Critics note how your party hasn’t fulfilled its housing goals during the last 4 years, so you better make good of your promises once you’re chancellor.
A2: We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards, available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as we do in NRW. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.
F1: A bit unorthodox for a Christian-Democrat to take such a regulatory approach - you break with current doctrines, but in a way that could be advantageous to you. Many agree something has to be done, urban and suburban voters might like this pivot. It’s also good to point to successful policies in NRW - even though this one was introduced by the SPD.
A3: The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a rent moratorium.
F3: Might I offer you a constitutional law lesson in these trying times? Similar plans in Berlin have been scrapped by the courts recently, to the applause of <i>your</i> colleagues! You’re echoing leftist sentiments - while maybe a few politically uninformed might be swayed, this runs counter to what your party and your potential voters want. 
A4: We are vehemently against programs like rent controls. Social housing projects have failed to improve the situation - instead housing subsidies will suffice. Regulations have to be cut back, we need slimmer bureaucracies and faster approval processes so that the market can sort itself out.
F4: A stringently supply-side answer that’s more expected from an American conservative instead of the Christian Democratic Union - while some hardliners cheer you on, most centrists, including Merkel’s administration, are a bit estranged from your plans - urban voters even more so.


Q16: July 2021: Catastrophe hits. The meteorological low-pressure area <i>Bernd</i> has hit Central Europe and made several rivers burst over their banks. Disastrous rain and floods are affecting large areas of Germany. The state you govern, North Rhine-Westphalia, is among the most affected - you are asked to comment.
A1: The most important thing we can do right now is help the affected regions with their crisis management. They need help now, quickly and unbureaucratically. I’m promising swift support.
F1: A succinct response, though some say that this is the least you can do. Help does get out quickly, and arrives at where it’s needed most, but critics see your response as somewhat passive in the face of the worst flood in Germany since 1962.
A2: I want to especially praise local teams and local reactions. Some areas already had crisis teams ready when the sun was still shining and no one knew what would happen. We will follow up and provide better crisis responses in the future.
F2: Your praises for local teams are duly noted, but many wonder why your own state government had no such crisis team ready despite weather warnings. At least you take responsibility, but admitting to your mistakes still focuses attention on your own misgivings and alleged incompetence. 
A3: First, we need to quickly and diligently help the affected regions with the cleanup operations. After that, we have to guarantee financial emergency aid for affected people, unequivocally.
F3: At first this quick statement of action is praised by the media, but it turns out, there are some inconsistencies with measures of your government two years prior, that hinder the rollout of financial aid to flood victims. It’s unclear if you or the former SPD administration is to blame, but the discussion mostly revolves around your misgivings, unfortunately.
A4: I want to honor the victims, but also address the cause of all this: climate change. Extreme weather events are unfortunately going to become more common -  we need to act decisively and swiftly now to keep global warming below 1.5°C so that we can prevent these disasters.
F4: The scientific community agrees - it’s good to not let the Green Party be the only ones who connect this to climate change, but this is an argument they have made for years. Focusing attention on this might help them more than you - but at the very least, you are taken a bit more seriously by environmentalists.

Q17: Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear: 220 fatalities, 186 of those in Germany, the deadliest flood since 1962.<br>Among the mourning, your advisors want you to position yourself as a man of action.
A1: Actually, I don’t want to be seen as performative. The cleanup operations can be left to professionals, I will keep coordinating the crisis efforts from the state chancellery so that everything goes smoothly - that’s the best I can do for the victims. 
F1: Some accuse you of missing in action and your advisors fear you might have missed an opportunity to convince the public of your leadership. That said, caution might be a good way of making sure your state gets through this crisis; quite Merkel-esque of you. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.
A2: I want to get out there, yes. I have to look at the carnage myself, at least for a day or two. NRW is among the most affected states after all. Let’s try to keep my visits below the radar though, so we don’t generate too much media buzz - that could be seen as opportunistic. Maybe some interviews with local newspapers and radio stations.
F2: Local media appreciates your visits, as the cleanup comes along smoothly. You do evade the national cameras, but the public sees your lowdown visit as irritating, awkward and hasty. At least your home state appreciates your prudence. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.
A3: What a great idea! We should get out there and visit some affected towns - our President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be here in a few days, so let’s try to get some shared pictures with our head of state. Catch some of his gravitas.
F3: A somber mood. Steinmeier comes forth to honor the victims. Just then, you silently crack a joke with district administrator Frank Rock - your boyish laugh is caught on camera, right there, behind Steinmeier’s eulogy! The shit storm ensues quickly, and <i>Laschet's Lacher</i> becomes one of the worst gaffes of 2021.
A4: What a great idea! We should get out there and visit some affected towns - our President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be here in a few days, so let’s try to get some shared pictures with our head of state. Catch some of his gravitas.
F4: Although nominally neutral, President Steinmeier is traditionally a member of the SPD, so there are some tense moments and awkward conversations. You do get the pictures you want though, and the media puts in some good words about your response, though Olaf Scholz seems to experience a small surge as well...

Q18: Climate change is a much-discussed topic again after the floods - it seems dire warnings of extreme weather events are starting to come true. In the wake of this, you have been asked if this had an impact on your stance on how to best combat climate change.
A1: The floods have shown that we need to be much more ambitious than before. One of the worst offenders is our energy production: we need to stop using coal for energy generation by 2030 and seek out new innovative technologies to keep energy affordable.
F1: This comes as sort of a bombshell statement - the GroKo has stood for an exit from coal by just 2038 before. NRW, a big producer of coal, as well as other regions, are unhappy - but this might prove to potential Green voters how serious you are when you talk about the climate.
A2: Climate change is coming, whether we want it or not. The most important thing we can do is mitigate its worst effects to prevent catastrophes like this from doing too much damage - we need better crisis responses. Climate action is necessary, as long as it doesn't stifle our economy and freedom of living.
F2: You won’t win over Green voters with nuances and reactionism, but your traditional base, who doesn’t want to see their way of life upended, is happy. A bit of conservatism between all the conservationism.
A3: Germany is no stranger to floods. I’m sorry, but just because today is a day like this, you don't just change your politics. The question of climate change is an international one, we can’t trivialize it like this. 
F3: Social media ensues in a shitstorm over this statement, and many voters see your attitude as tone-deaf and passive. You were handed a good opportunity for a pivot or a strong statement, and you squandered it with deflections.
A4: We clearly need to pick up the pace on climate action. But if you look back, it’s the environmentalist movement who concentrated on the wrong issue; for 20 years they’ve fought to end nuclear energy, instead of coal. Germany now exits nuclear as pretty much the only country! Our focus is misguided.
F4: Nuclear power is a controversial topic among the Germans. You might be right that nuclear energy could have helped with climate measures, but many see the exit as a settled issue. It doesn’t help that the decision to continue the phase-out was made by Merkel after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.

Q19: August 2021: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. Some media figures are now going as far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory. What do you think of this?
A1: Compulsion is the wrong way to go about this, and probably unconstitutional. Instead, we need to convince people of the dangers of not being vaccinated and to continue our information campaign as we are now.
F1: Compulsory vaccination is indeed unpopular, but you don’t offer any new solutions. You look passive. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A2: While I wouldn’t go that far, as we might run into legal issues, we should give people more incentives to get vaccinated. One solution might be to open up certain establishments from the lockdown, but only for vaccinated and recovered people.
F2: This statement is received quite well overall and might actually make vaccinations more attractive. Skeptics still feel alienated - better hope they’ll return from the fringes soon.
During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A3: Covid is basically over, the case numbers are very low. One has to be honest and ask: Do we even need such an expensive program? Vaccines are good to have, but we should focus on opening up and treating Covid as the non-problem it has become.
F3: Some from the <i> Querdenker</i>-anti-vax-movement take this as veiled sympathy. For anyone else though, this is a big gaffe - and you are forced to apologize shortly after. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A4: This might be a good idea. The country needs to move on, we need to do everything we can to finally make Covid history. At some point, we need to have the conversation about mandatory vaccines, and fine those that refuse to get one.
F4: Fair point, but compulsory vaccinations are generally unpopular, and some question if such a move is even legal. Like it or not, you’re a bit ahead of your time. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.

Q20: The SPD under Olaf Scholz has been surging in the polls, drawing votes from both you and the Green Party. There are still many undecided voters too, though: your advisors want to produce a good and impactful ad to hopefully sway some people in the home stretch of this campaign. What input do you give them?
A1: We have to modernize my image. Let’s incorporate some biographical elements, like that my father was a miner, and show pictures of how I closed the last mine in North Rhine-Westphalia. Then talk about tackling climate change together and how we need to promote tolerance.
F1: Well, you tried. Unfortunately, the video is widely mocked for how staged it seemed; among other things, you seemed to be the only one there who had a coal-smeared face. Others accuse you of queerbaiting due to you showing pictures of a Pride-rally.  Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A2: Covid is still on the mind of most people. Let’s focus on my response to this crisis, show me in a lab coat or something. With a strong vaccination campaign, we will continue Merkel's course and bring normalcy back!
F2: Covid is indeed on the mind of most people, but many are sick of hearing about it. The vaccination campaign is sluggish, and your spot does not have much in the way of proposals for what comes after Merkel - few talk about it in the end. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A3: It’s best to play it safe. My motto is “Making Germany Together” - I want a spot about how I’m bringing different people together and how our country needs solidarity in this crisis. Let’s show the diversity in our supporters and promise that we will bounce back stronger than before.
F3: People like your outreach to different groups, and appreciate your focus on solidarity. However, the uncontroversial nature of this ad is unlikely to sway many to your cause specifically - this just might not be the election for TV spots. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A4: I’ve been governing North Rhine-Westphalia successfully since 2017. I want to talk about my home, show my successes here and promise to bring them to Germany, as a <i>Landesvater</i>. Give off an air of trustworthiness - let’s even invoke chancellor Merkel’s“You know me.”-quip from 2013.
F4: You’re quite popular as Minister-President, and it does help to remind people of that. People are taken by you showing yourself at home and at work, although the Merkel-reference is quite corny, with the spot standing out to few. You might just need new ad people. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.

EQ6: A bit of a minor issue, but one that has gripped the imagination of many young voters is the topic of cannabis. Currently, it is a controlled substance, and illegal to produce, distribute or own. In light of worldwide movements to decriminalize or even legalize it: <i>Wann Bubatz legal</i>?
A1: Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.
F1: What a wildcard! This is a definitive change in pace for your party, who has advocated for a “drug free society” ever since its founding. This cautious pivot rankles moralists and the party base, particularly the CSU, but in other corners, your modernized stance is received with positive surprise.
A2: We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.
F2: “Cannabis is no broccoli” as drug commissioner Daniela Ludwig succinctly said. The Union’s line remains unchanged even in the face of developing popular opinions. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - legalization is still very controversial, and concerned parents are happy to have someone on their side.
A3: Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.
F3: Have you indulged yourself? To the CSU, it sounds like it: a public intraparty fight over drug policies ensues, and your CDU colleagues are hesitant to defend you, horrified themselves. Regardless of your personal stance, you’ve offended most of your voters for little gain and are forced to accept the restrictive party line in the end.
A4: Not at all: we need to further pursue drug users and lower the amount of cannabis that is legally prosecuted. Our goal is a drug free society. Look at the Netherlands, they have decriminalized the possession of just 5 grams, with fatal consequences - that won’t happen to our children.
F4: The cannabis question hasn’t been a particularly salient issue before, but by drawing the battle lines this clearly, you’ve dragged it into a certain limelight. The Greens and SPD vehemently oppose your harsh stance, and in the verbal conflict, it’s unclear who will profit. Better hope older voters are still as reliable in turnout.

Q21: There are 7 parties poised to enter parliament, and none has ever won an absolute majority since Adenauer in 1957. As such, it is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. You are asked ad-nauseam - who would you enter a coalition with?
A1: We will talk with all democratic parties - the SPD, the Greens and the FDP. However, I want to needle the leftist parties for not ruling out a coalition with the extremist Left. They are fringe populists, unfit to govern.
F1: This is your expected answer. The public seems to be on your side - a narrow plurality of people in polls seem to want Scholz and Baerbock to disavow the idea of Red-Red-Green, which they refuse to do. It seems redbaiting still works, 21 years after the end of the DDR.
A2: We rule out coalitions with the extremes. Normally we would talk with everyone in the center, but it’s clear how a continuation of the Grand Coalition of the last 8 years would not have a public mandate. We need to find a different governing majority.
F2: Some question if the Union and SPD will even have a majority, though such a blanket statement leaves you with few options later on. Let’s hope the Greens and FDP are ready for another try at the “Jamaica”-coalition - or if you’re lucky, you might only need one of them.
A3: The last few years have shown how we can not ignore the 10-15% of the populace voting for the AfD. This country needs change and new solutions. I think a Bahamas coalition with the AfD and the FDP could work - Austria showed us how the right wing can govern harmonically.
F3: This goes against everything thought to be certain - the firewall against the right has been broken down. Your stance is poison to most voters, SPD and Greens rule you out as chancellor in return, and even the FDP might be a hard sell now. The AfD is tempted by the prospect of power, but you’re a dubious personality to them.
A4: My favorite coalition would be Black-Yellow, like the one I’m leading in North Rhine-Westphalia now. The FDP is a reliable partner, and we could get some really good policies done together.
F4: A classic. It’s unlikely that black-yellow will have a majority, but one can dream, right? Keep in mind what the last Black-Yellow coalition did to the FDP though: After supporting Merkel for 4 years, they fell below 5% and completely vanished from the parliament for the first time ever.

EQ7: A defining social issue is the question of abortion. Currently, criminal law §218 disallows abortions generally, but decriminalizes them in case of rape, or if the pregnancy is under 12 weeks old. Additionally, §219a establishes an “ad ban” for doctors offering abortions. You’re asked for your stance on this controversial topic.
A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. Additionally, we need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: How unexpected! Many journalists praise you for your forward thinking and your genuinely progressive outlook - but the Union isn’t stoked at all, especially the CSU. While there are some who can see how §219a might be harmful, most don’t want to see you trivialize the right of the unborn like that.
A2: We want to strike $218, and 219 from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: There have been certain CDU politicians advocating against §218 all the way back in the ‘90s, people like Rita Süssmuth. They, however, have been repeatedly repudiated - and the same now happens to you. After you publicly have to elaborate your stance as a “third way” and reiterate personal moral objections, you’re in an awkward spotlight.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: This is a fine answer that doesn’t make this a bigger issue than it is. Standing by classic conservative moralism and Merkel’s policies here is expected and applauded by family advocacy groups. Let’s focus your campaign on topics that matter more.
A4: The right to life does not stand to disposition. The unborn child has a right to live, and we stand vehemently against efforts to trivialize or encourage abortions from the state. Instead, adoption procedures should be simplified - while doctors who do not report abortions have to incur noticeable sanctions.
F4: Moral issues really weren’t at the forefront of this campaign, but your strong answer has taken the attention of the political landscape. Some of your language is taken straight from the AfD, and women's groups vehemently denounce you. They’ll support Baerbock anyways, so let’s hope there’s a silent majority for your stance.

Q22: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. Many loyal locals are left behind, as the Taliban are poised to make a comeback. The government is sharply criticized for its botched evacuation - what stance do you want to take?
A1: This is the biggest debacle for NATO since its founding, but also a miscalculation on the part of the government. We need a relentless analysis of what went wrong. I also need to criticize the USA’s role in this, the mandate for our troops still went until 2022, but we can’t hold it down alone.
F1: Many see your analysis as correct, as the USA’s retreat was the deciding factor in this situation. It’s questionable though how much you can actually do about this as chancellor, and your party is unfortunately still the one in power, reaping the criticism from both sides.
A2: It’s a disgrace how so many good people would now have to live under civil strife and a possible Taliban takeover. We need to take in more refugees from Afghanistan, especially people who cooperated with the German troops. We owe it to them, after their generous help!
F2: Your sentiment is appreciated, but some inside your party fear a return of 2015. The AfD could profit from a new wave of refugees and plainly said, there are plenty of CDU voters who think that enough is enough. CSU hardliner and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is having none of it.
A3: Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD is clearly to blame for our part in this crisis, and has to take political responsibility. He should have started the evacuations much earlier, and there should be direct repercussions for his position.
F3: There’s some truth to that, but the SPD retorts by blaming the CDU-led Defence Ministry. Unproductive mudslinging ensues, with the most credible critique coming from the opposition. The media also does not appreciate you rattling on Merkel's cabinet so shortly before the election.
A4: Okay, uh… one thing’s clear, we can’t have a repeat of the refugee crisis in 2015. Let’s tell them, we are watching the situation closely, but we concur with Interior Minister Horst Seehofer that criminal refugees still have to be sent back to Afghanistan, with a zero-tolerance policy.
F4: This keeps the AfD at bay, but is sharply criticized from your left. Merkel managed to soften her image in 2015 by accepting the wave of refugees, and as you are doing the opposite now, many perceive you as ice-cold in the wake of a coming Taliban takeover. Maybe you want that?

Q23: September 2021: Official TV debates are a relatively recent phenomenon in Germany, only being consistently organized since 2002. Now, for the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Olaf Scholz and Annalena Baerbock are all invited. What is going to be your strategy?
A1: Olaf Scholz has been surging a lot in the polls recently and privately, I worry that he will not stop. We compete for a lot of voters with his wannabe-Merkel attitude - it seems foolish to do anything but attack him on his many weaknesses.
F1: It seems right now like Scholz has clawed his way back up top, so this seems like a prudent choice. Your advisors get out the oppo-research, now it’s up to you to stop his surge.
A2: Baerbock has been struggling lately, but the Greens are still a strong party with a vulnerable candidate, and some voters we could pick up. Let’s focus on her.
F2: Her numbers keep slipping, but the Greens are still a formidable force. Someone has to sweep up the rest of those voters. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - Let’s hope you can make it count.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America.
F3: With all cards on the table at the end of this campaign, the aura of a statesman might be your lucky break. People do like concrete soundbites - let’s hope taking the high road helps you stand out!
A4: Actually, I don’t want two left-wing politicians to gang up on me. This format is not up to the times and I can guarantee, time will not be allotted fairly to the only centrist party at the table. Thus, I must decline this invitation.
F4: Many question your judgment. The debate goes ahead without you - and makes it look like Greens and SPD compete for the chancellery, with the CDU as a petty third wheel. Scholz goes on to edge out Baerbock, but the real loser by default is Armin Laschet.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. There are plenty of avenues to attack him and stun his momentum - which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form a coalition with populist demagogues after the election?
F1: Scholz is in a bit of an awkward spot with this attack and doesn’t can’t give a clear answer. While Baerbock doesn’t either, she slips a bit under the radar. Overall, you and Baerbock tie the debate, as Scholz’s momentum with the political center is stunted.
A2: Let’s hit him on his scandals as finance minister. Under his watch, Wirecard collapsed due to fraudulent dealings and lots of people lost their money. We need to poke attention to the police raid on a government office belonging to his ministry - he refuses to take responsibility.
F2: A damaging attack, but he and Baerbock hit back by mentioning the corruption in your party like the mask dealings earlier this year. The debate gets ugly, you are taken aback, Scholz looks nervous - in the end, Baerbock manages to get out relatively unscathed, with her scandals running under the radar.
A3: Scholz likes to pretend he’s a moderate, but the program of his party is ideological and leftwing, with unrealistic promises regarding pensions and the minimum wage. It shows that the SPD as a whole is unfit to govern, and a symbol of past days.
F3: You might have had an opening there, but the second part is an odd avenue of attack considering the CDU had a coalition government with the SPD for the past eight years. Scholz rebukes this notion rather easily, successfully vindicates his policies and is seen as the winner of the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a statesman to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the mask scandal. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q25: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Annalena Baerbock, co-party leader and chancellor candidate of the Greens. Earlier scandals have already hurt her campaign, and you may now deliver the coup de grace. What do you want to emphasize?
A1: She’s had problems with plagiarism in her book, and she inflated her CV. These might seem like minor things, but in light of her lack of experience: can she really be trusted to govern this country, if she fails at these minor tasks?
F1: This is an expected attack, she did struggle to handle it - Baerbock calls the criticism unfair, but ultimately, you focus the spotlight on her misgivings. The post-Triell discourse turns toward experience and statesmanship. Overall, you and Scholz tie in that regard - the duopoly asserts itself, at least in the wake of the Triell.
A2: Everyone on this stage agrees that something has to be done about climate change, but what Mrs Baerbock and her party want can’t be the solution! We need to involve everyone, protect livelihoods and emphasize innovation, instead of blanket bans, as Mrs. Baerbock advocates.
F2: This devolves into a heated back and forth between the two of you on climate policy. Baerbock has a bit of a leg up on the details, but it’s true that policies like tempo limits are controversial. Though it’s really Scholz who manages to strike a healthy middle ground to take away the win.
A3: I’ll attack her for her willingness to govern with the radical Left party. Moderates should be frightened by this prospect, there should be a firewall against Radicals of all stripes, and entertaining a coalition with Die Linke, as the Greens do repeatedly, is irresponsible.
F3: This is a bit of a weak spot, but she does counter with some harsh words about Die Linke’s foreign policy. In the end, you’re just posturing - Scholz flies under the radar with his calm demeanor, and although he has the same problem, you were busy sparring with Baerbock. He wins the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - I’ll just broadly criticize Baerbock for her incompetence and then just wing it, relying on my instincts as a statesman to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. Your criticism of Baerbock is perceived as a sexist dog whistle, and you get awfully defensive about it. Baerbock is quite offended while Scholz has a good performance, but the attention is clearly on your awful gaffe.

Q26: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the CDU/CSU programs, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: I want to present myself as a candidate for pragmatic solutions to climate change. We clearly have to take action: What we need is room for market innovation and international cooperation. I’m proud of the path Germany is on in this regard - we don’t need strict bans.
F1: Baerbock criticizes you sharply, and you are drawn into back-and-forths on her turf after all. She provides some blistering critiques, while some of your points are even negatively noted by fact checkers afterwards. Scholz ducks the shootout and comes out victorious: the Germans just really like his calm attitude, it seems.
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason. We have tax and social security plans that are actually affordable and generally promise sensible governance. The CDU is the party of the healthy center - of competency and fiscal responsibility. 
F2: With two leftwingers making the same arguments against you, you do manage to catch some sympathy as the underdog. You use this to convince voters to worry about how Scholz and Baerbock want to pay for their proposals and potential tax hikes - you come out on top.
A3: You know me. I’m a known quantity from North Rhine-Westphalia, where I’ve governed with prudence and caution - just like Chancellor Merkel. I’m the candidate who stands for a continuation of the Merkel era - with me, Germany will stay on its successful path.
F3: Yes, Merkel is popular, but after 16 years of conservative governance, the country seems ready for some change and fresh air. You posture yourself as embodying the Status Quo, while Scholz actually makes a case for change with a Merkel-esque persona. Unfortunate, but the public gives him the edge.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. We have enough ammunition to show Baerbocks and Scholz’ incompetence, and I shouldn’t be afraid to use it. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You go on to throw around insubstantial claims of corruption towards Scholz on Wirecard and borderline sexist critiques of Baerbock’s competence. You’ve sharpened your profile alright: <i>Die Bild</i> calls you the <i>Anti-Merkel</i>. In such a climate, Scholz’s calm attitude really caught on, unfortunately.
EQ8: Along with the <i> Triell </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i>Vierkampf</i>. While the Greens have seemingly eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Alexander Dobrindt of the CSU, the smaller sister of the Union, debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – unfortunately, this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, counter to prior hopes.
A2: Let's hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If the FDP matches or surpasses their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let's hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Alexander Dobrindt made a surprisingly strong case for you as the pragmatic heir to the Merkel era. This might help the CSU solidify its historical dominance in Bavaria, but it also garners some goodwill for you.
A4: Let's hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…



Q27: The 26th of September is almost here. Finally, this historically important campaign is coming to an end. Hopefully, though, 16 good years of CDU governance won’t! In your final lap for this year, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the CDU has a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F1: Merz competently rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show some backbone and confidence to your party. Now, it’s time now to huddle down in your home in Aachen, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Making Germany Together”.
A2: Who else but Chancellor Angela Merkel could be the right person? She is a figure larger than life, a great icon who has won the last four elections, and I want to show people that I’m the one to continue her legacy.
F2: The outgoing chancellor herself is still popular, and this can really give some credence to you being the rightful heir of this era - with her last hurrah, she issues you a strong endorsement. For you, it’s time to huddle down in your home in Aachen, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Making Germany Together”.
A3: No matter what happens, we have to make sure the right-wing demagogues do not increase their vote shares. I’m worried about the AfD taking first place in some East German states, and direct mandates could go to them: I need to campaign broadly in the New States, with local colleagues like Haseloff and Kretschmer.
F3: The firewall against the right wing is defended in the east, it seems. There’s nothing left but hope that you did enough to give AfD voters a reason to come back to the center. Now, it’s time to huddle down in your home in Aachen, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Making Germany Together”.
A4: Markus Söder and I didn’t always have the warmest relationship, but there is a reason he gave me such a scare - the man has charisma. Let’s campaign with him in Bavaria and show some unity between the CDU and CSU.
F4: He is definitely popular and happy to campaign with you in his home state. He sends you home with a hearty invitation for the Oktoberfest next month - hopefully as a guest of honor in victory! For you, it’s time now to huddle down in your home in Aachen, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Making Germany Together”.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Mitte
EQ8: Up until now, your campaign has embraced a classical moderate-conservative Christian Democracy, mostly following the center-right party doctrine. Some advisors want you to pivot further left towards the median voter, while others want you to take the AfD’s wind out of their sails. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand by my moderate credentials, I am a proud Christian Democrat. However, we are competing with two left-wing alternatives- in order to win a strong mandate, we need to pivot leftwards, toward the center.
F1: A classic electoral tactic. Your pivot comes at the cost of an unenthused party base - but if you keep them from voting for the AfD, there’s not much competition for you. It is a bit of a gamble, but it could pay off.
A2: The CDU is the party of the center. We have done a great job at governing over the last 16 years, and while we need to move into the future, our future is a Christian-Democratic one. I stand by my course.
F2: Giving nods to each side of the aisle keeps your party united and conflict-free. This is always helpful for the perception of your competency. This is a healthy antidote to the infighting your party has experienced earlier this year.
A3: Merz has tapped into a surprisingly large voter potential in 2018: Merkel-sceptic conservatives. The chancellor has become popular with voters of the other parties - for us, some of her policies are a bit more controversial. On these issues, we definitely need to move rightwards - to provide for a real alternative to the Greens and SPD.
F3: The word “alternative” isn’t lost to your advisors, and your pivot does solidify your right flank. The fact that you have less competition on this side of the spectrum might have you coming out in first place by default - but there are still grumblings about the distance you’re taking from Merkel.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Rechts
EQ9: Up until now, your campaign has been met with a noticeable hardline-conservative tone,  seemingly wanting to take the party rightwards, somewhat evocative of the CDU pre-Merkel. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand for what I think is right, but it’s become clear to me we need to defuse ourselves. Let’s reconcile with the more leftwards elements of the party - so that they won’t defect to the Liberals, or even our opponents.
F1: There are some who are indeed on the edge of defection - some of them already jumped off, as the polls show. Your efforts could prevent the worst - but you risk coming off as a flip-flopper without principles.
A2: Yes. I stand for what I believe is right in this country, and it’s clear how we need a change in attitude in Germany to stay competitive. Our standing in the world is decreasing, and we need to work towards improving our country to be the best it can be, because we are patriots.
F2: Patriotism has been a dodgy topic in Germany since the end of the war - but mostly on the left anyway. When you hold a speech the next day echoing your stance, you energize your supporters, turn some heads in the AfD and reap the approval of your eastern state parties. Just Merkel-loving centrists are a bit irritated by your grandstanding.
A3: Look - chancellor Merkel is a competent woman who I respect. But the fact of the matter is, her policies have tilted leftwards, both socially and economically. What our country needs in the post-Merkel era are policies more in line with conservative doctrines - the AfD’s success has shown that. If anything, we need to come back to our roots and move this country to the right.
F3: Your biting ideological stance as well as your outright Merkel critiques leak out to the press and dominate the headlines for a few days. Greens and SPD immediately shoot back, even almost defending the chancellor from you - as well as getting more and more wary about working with you in a potential coalition agreement. 

(Q14
A4: While the results in Saxony-Anhalt are definitely praiseworthy, me and my surrogates should focus on Baerbock’s scandals. We’re running a national campaign - and directly dealing with our opponent might be better than lingering on state elections.
F4: You keep the attention on Baerbocks scandals - finally, a break in the Greens unlikely surge. That said, you could also push voters away from your own successes - depending on how you frame your attacks.
