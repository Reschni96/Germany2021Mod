Greens-Baerbock

EQ1: The year is 2018. Millions of German teenagers protest in the streets. Fridays For Future demands for „Climate Justice“. In between all the frustration with the political status quo, your party experiences a vindication of its environmental policies and a gigantic polling surge. You've just been voted in as party leader – how do The Greens plan to capitalize on this 'wind of change'?
A1: We are the opposite of the AfD. In times where the parliament pivots rightwards, where sexism and racism are back on the agenda, it's The Greens job to hold up high the left-liberal, emancipatory flag. If we can position ourselves as the primary voice for progressives, the media will focus on our values. And this is only the beginning.
F1: In the post 2015-discourse, while every other party seems divided over where society is headed, you provide for a clear contrast and a loud voice for progressives all over the country. Of course, this puts you in a direct confrontation with those who feel alienated by the political leftwards turn, particularly the AfD. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A2: We need to put climate change into the center of every politic. We support „Fridays For Future“ – they want an awakening, because they know, this is about the future of all of us. Let's stand with them in the streets, protesting for a cleaner and safer tomorrow. And this is only the beginning.
F2: The youth seems as politically active as they haven't been in years. Famous Youtuber Rezo even produces a viral video in 2019, chastising the government's climate policies. You are the ‘party of the environment’ and this is your core constituency - your activation of young voters displays strength and garners momentum, even among some parents. br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A3: We aren't just firmly situated in the leftist camp - we need to become the leading party of the center-left. The SPD is weak, if we can position ourselves as the more credible option for disappointed Social Democrats, especially on social policy, we will supersede them as the party of the left spectrum. And this is only the beginning.
F3: The „Good Old“ SPD certainly seems to be on its last legs these days. It's been a downward spiral ever since Schröder lost to Merkel – and in between neoliberalism and three GroKo's, they've seemingly lost so much of their profile that The Greens seem like a good option to many of their former voters nowadays. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A4: We need a fresh breath of air after these 14 years of Merkel and GroKo's. The progressive, modern center is getting more and more carved out – all the more important it becomes to do optimistic politics. It's now our job to make a political and societal offer, as an alternative to the status quo. And this is only the beginning.
F4: You and Robert Habeck are a young, dynamic duo, popular in your appearances, drawing a nice contrast to the old, unpopular politicians of the establishment. While you're avoiding more specific lines, people start to perceive The Greens as an actual opportunity for change. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…

Q2: It’s finally 2021. It’s getting real - election season is here.<br>Although your momentum from 2018 has been stopped by Covid, the CDU still seems vulnerable with its own crisis in leadership post-Merkel. Meanwhile, The Greens are in second place, and you’re gonna have to discuss who’s going to be the first Green chancellor candidate. <br>You and your co-leader Robert Habeck plan to announce something next month: until then, what do you want to do in the meantime?
A1: I want to detail my visions for the future in my new book: “Now - How we’re renewing our Country”. When I’ll release it this summer, I want it to be good - so I’ll focus all my energy on finishing it and making some touch-ups.
F1: With great vigor, you continue to work on your book, and indeed, you find some passages that might need clarifications and sources. While you’re enveloped by your writing, you seem invisible to the voters; but maybe, once the book releases, it can produce some good media coverage.
A2: If I want to become chancellor, I have to have a clean presentation, and can’t afford any sloppiness, especially as a woman. I’ll make sure things like my finances are in order while my team will give me a thorough background check.
F2: There’s not much to do for you - you fix up some minor irregularities in your CV and report some small earnings that you almost forgot about to the parliament. That said, your thorough self-background-check is taking up a lot of time that could’ve been spent appealing to voters - here’s hoping your integrity will stand out.
A3: My name recognition is not that high compared to Robert. I want to get out there, go to talk shows, give interviews, and generally make sure the German people know me.
F3: You were called “talk show queen” in 2019, and with your repeated visits to talk shows like “<i>Hart aber fair</i>” and “<i>Maischberger</i>”, the media chatters wildly about your ambitions. Both your name recognition and your favorability numbers improve in the coming weeks.
A4: Friday for Future is capable of mobilizing a massive amount of people. We need to restart the “climate summer” and focus media attention on the environmentalist movement. I will visit some demonstrations and meet with the FFF-leadership to get them on our side.
F4: Luisa Neubauer, main coordinator of FFF Germany, is indeed a Green party member, but she’s not a diehard loyalist: even your party has been criticized by Fridays for Future for not being ambitious enough. Still: your efforts effectively mobilize the youth vote and pad out your floor in polling.

Q1: Unfortunately for you, the surge doesn’t last. The Corona Pandemic hits in 2020, and quickly dominates the news, politics and daily life. Merkel regains popularity in leading the crisis response, although soon after, cracks start to show. With the Greens not governing on the federal level, you can do little in terms of actual policy - how do you frame your stance on the government's Covid policies?
A1: Overall, we support the government’s policies. I will criticize their chaotic response, but we can not endanger societal cohesion: in contrast to the AfD, we’ll make it clear that we broadly stand behind all necessary measures.
F1: Certainly admirable. The German people are happy, and you don’t attract negative headlines while building bridges with the government parties. You aren’t really blunting the CDU’s momentum, but maybe that can wait until election season.
A2: Since the beginning of the pandemic, there hasn’t been enough of a focus on children and families. We need to build the circumstances to return to regular schooling, we need tests in daycares and schools, as well as fight the lack of teachers. There has to be an educational package for all kids in this country.
F2: If you want to stand out in attacking the government, this is a good way to go about it. As a parent of young children yourself, these remarks come off as authentic: many feel that the needs of their kids have not been adequately met. Also, many young students might be first-time-voters for you, come election season.
A3: While the lockdowns were absolutely necessary at the beginning of the pandemic, we should be mindful - there has to be a balance between freedom and safety. The curfews, for example, are a strong restriction of a basic right that might not be proportional - we always have to see if we can use milder methods.
F3: Although many restrictions are unpopular, most experts agree that they are necessary right now. Your party doesn’t seem to agree on a clear stance - some say, you’re doing opposition for opposition's sake. That said, you continue to foster an unlikely friendship with the FDP - a relationship that might become useful after the next election…
A4: We support measures to combat Covid, and we need to support those affected by the economic impacts, but during all this, we can not forget the climate crisis. Every summer gets warmer, and there won’t be a vaccine against climate change. Aid for industrial corporations should always be mindful of their ecological modernization.
F4: An attempt at Agenda-Setting? Of course, when the conversation revolves around the climate, your party is perceived as competent - but with the ubiquity of Covid in people’s lives, your statement doesn’t really hit the spot. At least you’ve riled up the climate skeptics…

Q3: April 2021: After long discussion between yourself and Robert, you’ve come to an agreement with him. You both want to avoid a chaotic contest, and with a bit of wistfulness, he agrees to give you precedence to become chancellor candidate. The nomination of your party will now just be a formality.<br>Alright Annalena, you’re it! Now is the time to break the news and to give your announcement speech as the first ever Green chancellor candidate!
A1: With my candidacy, I want to make the whole country an offer —a compelling invitation to lead our diverse and prosperous nation into a bright future. Our politics needs courage to do things differently. A country that’s more just, in which daycare and schools are beautiful places, in which the state works digitally, and in which we have a foundation for welfare and security.
F1: The media is surprised that you’re the Green candidate, but your vague, broad appeal is decently received. Many have been speculating if The Greens are the next ‘Volkspartei’ - this speech seems to seal the deal. With both CDU and SPD struggling in the polls, you might be able to win a generic popularity contest, if you can outshine the other candidates with your pitch: “Ready, because you are”.
A2: I want the politics of a new government to make climate change the benchmark for every area, to fulfill the goals of the Paris agreement. Forty years ago, the Green Party was founded to make our politics care more about the environment. Today, I continue in this tradition, as the only candidate that truly takes climate change seriously.
F2: Although most thought Habeck would win out, your party is as fired up as ever by your spirited defense of the party’s main identity. Is it enough to win? With the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls, an energized campaign might very well be worth a try. “Ready, because you are”.
A3: After eight years of Grand coalition and sixteen years of CDU chancellorship, we need change - we need to have a new political culture. A Green chancellor candidacy stands for a new understanding of political leadership. Yes, I haven’t been chancellor or Minister: I am running for a renewal. The status quo is represented by others.
F3: Although many doubted you to really become chancellor candidate, your appeal to a renewed politics works wonders, and with the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls right now, you might be able to deliver in the fall. Many voters now have high hopes for you as the next generation of leadership. Your motto says as much: “Ready, because you are”.
A4: The Greens are the new center. We need changes instead of promises - and now is a good time to lead a good government. Politics works in the concrete for the people: we need to do politics from the concrete and to provide agreeable policies, good compromises, for all of us. It can work!
F4: In a double-surprise, not only are you announced to be chancellor candidate, your speech is also perceived as quite centrist. You seem to gamble that the Fundis-wing of the Party is truly dead, evoking Winfried Kretschmann’s attitude. As both the CDU and SPD are struggling, there might be an opening for you with their voters - but be mindful of your base. They’re only “Ready, because you are”.

Q4: After a messy contest, the CDU has chosen Armin Laschet over Markus Söder as their chancellor candidate. The bruising cockfight and the recent Mask scandal, where some of their MPs were caught selling overpriced medical masks, have cost the CDU a lot of support in the polls - hopefully, you can capitalize on this. Meanwhile, the SPD has chosen Olaf Scholz last year already to lead them into this pivotal race.<br> With all three main parties having chosen their candidates, it's time to decide on a general strategy for this pivotal race.
A1: It’s clear that the SPD is not going to win this election. I want to present myself as the main candidate of the left-of-center and try to coalesce left-wing voters around the Greens. If we can make this a one-on-one against Laschet, I’m sure our appeal to change will win over the status quo.
F1: Your traditional base has seemingly expanded, ever since the SPD collapsed into the sub-twenties. Some pundits wonder though, if hitting downwards is the right way to capitalize on the Greens' newfound polling highs. Defending your second place seems a bit cautious, and leftist infighting might be beneficial to critics from your right.
A2: Traditionally, the Greens have been a left-of-center party. However, these are exceptional circumstances. We need to draw voters from our main competitor, the CDU - Armin Laschet is a weak candidate, and I can present myself as a competent alternative to the status quo that he embodies. We might have to amend our rhetoric on some topics to do this.
F2: The core base of the CDU might be impossible to crack, and attacks from your left follow swiftly due to your pivots. However, there's not much enthusiasm around Laschet, and he’s a vulnerable target - presenting yourself as a viable alternative to swing voters might be the way to go.
A3: Our base is largely young, urban, and well-off - with the right strategy, we can generate an enthusiasm unseen in past Federal Elections. They are frustrated, and we have actual credentials for them. We will put more resources into mobilization efforts to get the youth to turn out this election. Maybe we can get a Rezo-endorsement?
F3: Your turnout-focused strategy might get more first-time voters to the polls, but this might not be enough to expand into first place. The electorate skews older in almost every election, and your core base only netted you around 8.9% last time - the sheer number of old people in Germany might just be too large. Meanwhile, Rezo declines to actually endorse anyone publicly, although he does publish another video attacking the Unions Covid-policies.
A4: Our polling numbers in West Germany are great, but we are struggling to even get to 10% in many East German states. East Germany has been neglected by the status quo for a long time, and we might be able to present our ideas of change to an untapped voter potential there.
F4: Until now, the Green Party message really didn't seem to resonate with East Germany - instead, the party is mostly confined to the cities, being seen as “elitist”. The region is known for low turnout in general though - maybe you can get some of those people to go out and vote Green this time?

Q5: With a Green chancellor now looking like a realistic option, many skeptics of the past are giving the party a second look. One issue that might make them suspect is foreign policy - The Greens historically stem from the pacifist movement, although there seemingly has been a change ever since Joschka Fischer was Vice Chancellor. As a foreign policy expert yourself, an interviewer asks you for your focus on Germany’s role in the world.
A1: While we want to remain a member of NATO, of course, I am skeptical towards the goal to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. We can’t just raise the defense budget, we need to improve our capabilities and prevent crises before they happen.
F1: Foreign policy is not a big deal in this election, but the CDU of course continues to needle you. There is concern about the state of the Bundeswehr, although your answer has appeal to those weary of warmongering and the broader center-left, without being too aggravating. The fiscal wiggle room later on might also be worth it.
A2: We have to be tougher on states that don’t care about human rights, like Russia and China. For example, I’m in favor of stopping the construction of the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline and stopping the import of products from China that might have been produced using forced labor.
F2: The Greens really have changed - this positions you as arguably more hawkish than your opponents. Your steadfast position is appreciated by human rights activists and lands well with the electorate, but several experts are alarmed about the stability of the energy supply and the benefits of Free Trade. Let's hope this position will be vindicated come September.
A3: The Green Party has always been the party of pacifism. We need to overthink our levels of military spending and discuss if pure military alliances like NATO have any future. Instead, we should think more European.
F3: 30 years ago, this would have been a mainstream position within your party - now, it’s on the fringe, and a worldview too simplistic for the median voter. The SPD smells weakness and needles you on your stance towards NATO - are The Greens not ready for leadership after all, or do you believe in a silent majority?
A4: I stand for a value-based foreign policy - particularly, a feminist foreign policy. We need to fight for the rights, ressources and representation of girls and women worldwide and strengthen societal diversity, to overcome violence and discrimination. A foreign policy that includes, not excludes. When women are safer, everyone is safer.
F4: The word “feminism” or course immediately rings the right-wing alarm bells, and they sure are letting you know on social media. Although several academics and party activists applaud you, your wonky rhetoric doesn’t really stick the landing with the average voter. Leave the IR-theories for after the election!

EQ2: You’re invited to a talk show about immigration and refugees. Although tempers have cooled a bit since 2015, the discussion around Merkel's decision to welcome the refugees 6 years ago is still relevant - particularly for the AfD, who got driven into parliament on this issue in 2017. Germany is still a popular destination for many foreigners seeking a better life, yet the nation does not seem prepared for this. What stance do you take in this debate?
A1: I supported Merkel's decision at the time, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency Frontex.
F1: European cooperation is your strong suit, and your answer is positively noted by some formerly skeptical pundits - but this still leaves a weird conservative aftertaste in the mouth of your supporters. Normally, the Greens are quite multiculturalist; now, the SPD might actually outflank you on this issue, if you can believe it.
A2: There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.
F2: While many expected you to focus on humanitarianism, your embrace of qualified immigration is well received by pragmatists. A few activists want you to go further - they are uncomfortable with you ranking immigrants on their economic potential, and smell an unwanted pivot on refugees.
A3: Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We say: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.
F3: A strong principled stance that follows progressive doctrine. You’re probably the party best-positioned to represent the cultural left on this issue. You can use that to your advantage, as long as you don’t let right wing trolls get under your skin.
A4: On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - 2015 can’t repeat itself.
F4: Wh-what? Did you have an eye-opening talk with Boris Palmer? Journalists speculate that this was an attempt at a joke. Your party is shocked beyond belief and forces you to apologize the next day - but the damage is already done. The AfD feels humorously satisfied at you vindicating them, as your support plummets in favor of Scholz and other progressives.

Q6: May 2021: This might be your lucky break. Another scandal for the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin is now working on passing a stricter law - you’re participating in the debate about this in the Bundestag.
A1: We can’t hide behind goals and numbers, we need concrete measures! If you promise a forest, you need to plant the trees. We need a government that makes climate protection the core of every political action, with a rapid Climate Protection program! We wasted a lot of time in the last few years, and we need to make up for it with swift action.
F1: This is a valid critique that is shared by many experts - the Climate Protection Act certainly has ambitious goals, but lacks a concrete path to get there. Your party is the leading voice on environmentalism to the public, and this focus on action is certain to strengthen that view.
A2: The Federal Courts have given us a clear message: if you protect the climate, you’re protecting freedom. Five years ago, this house ratified the Paris climate accords. Every democratic party here agrees that something needs to be done, so let’s find solutions together.
F2: You’re emphasizing consensus here, hoping for a quick resolution - although the government parties still don’t involve your ideas in their new draft, you’ve shown your goodwill and ability to compromise to centrist voters. But are compromises really what the Germans want in this day and age?
A3: This is no room for party-political games, we have an obligation to act here and today. The CDU has failed us for 16 years, and the SPD is complicit! Climate protection through Sunday speeches doesn’t suffice. They have failed to promote renewable energies and endangered countless jobs!
F3: The Greens clearly feel vindicated after this decision. Just don’t squander your newfound goodwill here - the Germans want a concrete plan. Putting the spotlight on changing the status quo keeps their favorability low, but your appeal stays vague and unfocused.
A4: We have had many transformations in the history of this country: Introducing the social market economy after World War 2, the reunification and European integration after 1990. Now is the time for another transformation: a Green New Deal for Europe, in an alliance with the USA. This problem can only be solved internationally.
F4: Your focus on Europe is viewed favorably by pragmatists, although the “Green New Deal” quickly becomes a favorite buzzword among the Right. Some activists seem disappointed about your vague stance and are suspicious of what seems like mere lip service - they want more concrete leadership in Germany.

Q7: The party has accepted your chancellor candidacy with great enthusiasm. Only your co-chair, Robert Habeck, seems a bit deflated - clearly he had his own ambitions, but stepped gracefully aside for you. However, it can’t be understated how popular he is, still topping you in the polls even. How do you plan to utilize him in your campaign?
A1: Robert is a lovably stoic North German. As a former minister, he’s bound to be popular in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein - I want him to utilize his local connections and charm there, to give us the inroads with rural voters that we need. On the national stage however, I want myself to be center stage.
F1: Robert is a natural at stamping through the mud flats of Sylt, in talking to pensioners on the coast or farmers in the inlands of his home. However, it becomes clear, he feels a bit sidelined -  and lets the media subtly know, through some snide remarks. There is speculation that you’re scared of his popularity, and don’t want to feel upstaged.
A2: We are co-party leaders and I want to campaign a lot as a dynamic duo. While I’ll focus on climate protection, foreign policy and general leadership, he’s especially knowledgeable on economic and fiscal policy, so I want him to focus on his strengths there. Together we can show how The Greens are broadly ready to take responsibility!
F2: Robert is happy to cooperate with you, and his popularity does wonders for you. There are talks of him becoming Minister of Finances after the election - although in between those, there’s the occasional whisper around why he isn't the chancellor candidate. But those are undoubtedly just of a sexist nature - either way, your harmony is regarded well.
A3: Robert ist the one with government experience here. I’ll mostly talk about my visions for the country, our Green ideology and our stance against the status quo, while he can focus on the policy details and explaining them to the common voter.
F3: Robert is pretty good at explaining your policies - his “no-bullshit-attitude” goes over well with potential voters. Perhaps a bit too well - with your vagueness, people are wondering why you are the candidate instead of him. Even some internal cadres complain about your invisibility, and your personal numbers experience a small drop.
A4: As a woman, any critiques I’ll say will get torn up by the media as unlikeable and hysterical - just think of Hillary Clinton. Robert might be able to help us here - he can serve as our attack dog on Laschet and Scholz, while I remain above the fray with a positive attitude.
F4: Good thinking, but Roberts personality is just not suited for that task. The times he tries to go on the attack, he often comes across as bizarre and frustrated. The man seems stressed and vicious - his popularity sinks, while your opponents seem mostly unfazed. This might hurt more than it helps.

Q8: This shouldn’t have happened. Of all people, <i>Die Bild</i> just broke a “scandal” about you. </br>Over the past few years, you’ve received several payments from the Green Party for your activity as party leader. It wasn’t a lot of money, and it was perfectly legal - but you’ve forgotten to report them to the parliament on time. Given how the Greens are advocating for more transparency of MP’s earnings, this is an unnecessarily embarrassing faux-pas. The media immediately jumps on it, and asks for your comment.
A1: I will apologize for this mistake, I’ve reported these earnings now. This wasn’t a big deal, but it was still unnecessary and frustrating. This will not reflect my chancellorship - I hope people will quickly move on from this.
F1: While this usually really wouldn’t be a big deal, and your supporters stand by you, it’s still a bad bout of media coverage for you. Maybe people are measuring with double standards due to your gender? Who knows, but you better be careful from now on…
A2: I admit, this was a small lapse of judgment - but it’s nothing compared to the corrupt mask deals in the CDU/CSU and Scholz’ Wirecard and cum-ex scandals. I am still the candidate with the most integrity; I stand by my mistakes and fix them, while Laschet staves off critics and Scholz “can’t remember”.
F2: This leads to accusations being thrown around between all three parties, dragging down everyone’s favorability numbers. This campaign suddenly got a lot more dirty - populists on both sides of the aisle salivate at the mudslinging, seeking to capitalize on the frustrations of the ordinary citizen.
A3: Other politicians have received much higher payments in the same timeframe, and also haven’t reported them. This is why the Green Party stands for more transparency regarding the earnings of MPs. Our party actually acts on these promises.
F3: Fair enough, but this seems a bit hypocritical in the wake of your scandal - a bad bout of media coverage for you. Maybe people are measuring with double standards due to your gender? Who knows, but you better be more careful from now on…

Q9: Climate action is the Green’s main topic. While many voters want stricter environmental policies, Germany is also the “country of cars”. Due to this, there’s a certain disconnect between the Greens' promise to lower CO²-emissions and the Germans' love for automobiles: in an interview, you’re asked what your policies might mean for the price of gasoline.
A1: I grew up in the countryside myself, I know you need a car there - we broadly need a switch to cleaner cars though. If we want to lower our carbon emissions, under my plan, the price of gasoline has to rise by about 16 cents per liter over the next five years.
F1: This might be helpful for the climate - but with gas prices at an all-time high already, this topic is what keeps the Greens weak in rural regions and among some swing voters. Laschet immediately jumps on your comments - it might be best to move on to something more advantageous.
A2: Mainly, we want to strengthen public transit and alternative sources of fuel. As the price of CO2 rises, so will the price of gasoline. We have to keep an eye on affordability, but unfortunately, a price hike is unavoidable. The question is, are we leaving everything to stay the same, or will we finally change something?
F2: At least you are trying to hedge the issue and be mindful of the impacts of a higher price, but there are still people wondering about your vagueness on concrete numbers.
</br>The word “unfortunately” unfortunately just isn't very popular politically. How unfortunate.
A3: As climate change gets worse, we need to be resolute. Gas prices have to rise a lot - around 28 cents per liter over the next five years. We need to invest in public transit as well to make individual traffic less attractive overall. Buses and trains are where our future lies.
F3: Everyone but the most ardent environmentalists is deeply alarmed by this statement - they fear they wouldn’t be able to afford a car anymore. Rural voters are especially skeptical towards this stance - after all, buses aren’t popular, and the train network is… well… administered by the Deutsche Bahn.
A4: With our crumbling public transport, cars are necessary for our rural population. After the price for CO2 went into effect at the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen by 6 cents per liter already - for now, this is enough. Climate protection still has to be affordable.
F4: The interviewer is (perhaps positively) surprised - your clear pivot is noted by the media. Fridays For Future calls for its supporters to vote for special “Climate Lists”, instead of you. This will hurt your momentum with young voters - here's hoping you can make inroads among groups that turn out more reliably.

Q10: Since 2005, long-time unemployed people in Germany get money from the state at the subsistence level, the so-called Hartz IV. However, the amount of this aid is quite small, and recipients receive sanctions if they are not looking for a job. Many people are not happy with this system that the Greens helped introduce - what is your stance nowadays?
A1: We need to replace the Hartz IV-system with a “citizen’s money”, in which recipients would receive at least 50€ more. There should be no more sanctions if someone isn’t actively looking for a job, and there will be other reliefs, in the form of price caps on gas and electrical energy.
F1: Your answer echoes the most immediate concerns that left-wingers have with Hartz IV, though still being palpable for moderates. Many are dissatisfied with the current system, and winning brownie-points among your base is a good way of keeping everyone content. Hopefully your policies will prove effective.
A2: The current level of Hartz IV is a disgrace. The system needs to be reworked from the ground-up, and needs to be a massive raise, by around 200€, accounting for inflation. The sanctions are also unnecessary and inhumane, they should end. We also need further aid, like basic child security funding.
F2: With your staunchly leftwing a position, you siphon over some Left voters and poorer people. Your strong stance isn’t exactly out of character, but it frightens some fiscal moderate Realos, while conservatives attack you for wanting unchecked government handouts.
A3: Instead of Hartz IV, there should be a higher, universal basic income for all people in Germany, around 1200€ as a minimum income. While this is expensive, the savings on bureaucracy make it possible to finance this.
F3: There have been numerous discussions about this idea in your party. The state-provided minimum income appeals to ardent left-wingers, while the promises of bureaucracy reform might even be appealing to some eccentric fiscal conservatives. On the whole though, experts doubt your math here - this idea is still on the fringe and not all that popular.
A4: The system needs some minor adjustments - we can look into gradually raising the amount of money paid out and lessen the applied sanctions. However, we have to be careful that it doesn’t become excessive - overall, the Hartz system is sound.
F4: Rhetoric like this is less leftist than voters are used to from you. Some moderates might like this, although a lot of Fundis as well as the Green Youth seem irritated at best. You could broaden your base like this: it was your party after all, who participated in the introduction of Hartz IV under Gerhard Schröder.

Richtungsfrage Mitte
EQ3: With you as chancellor candidate, the Green campaign finally got going. One reason for your success might be your perceived pragmatism: the Realo-wing of the party has finally taken over and made the Greens electable for the average German. Others say, the increased salience of climate change has given the Green’s policies a new relevance in the political landscape. In an internal meeting you’re asked frankly: “How do we win this thing?”
A1: There’s a wind of change blowing through Germany: climate change is finally taken seriously by the media. We are perceived as most competent on this issue - as long as we press the attack and define a solid profile on climate action, we can keep up our momentum all the way to election day.
F1: Climate change is what catapulted you into your pole position in the first place - it’s not a bad thing to frame this election around your strongest issue. You are expected to branch out a bit though, The Greens have often been criticized as a “one-issue-party”- if you can show off some real leadership, maybe that can change.
A2: I think the people are tired of politics-as-usual, especially after 16 years of Merkel. I will run on an optimistic take - “Germany can do so much more”. Let’s stand by our stances and campaign on the issues without getting intimidated - ignore the mudslinging, and trust in our sympathy levels.
F2: Germans certainly haven’t been too keen on egregious mudslinging in the past. Your principled stance gains some early praise - but if you want to keep this up, you can’t let the campaign get derailed by character-issues, or else you’ll seem tone-deaf. Hopefully, everything around your person is in good order.
A3: Of course, people want change - but in order for them to follow through, we need to make our rhetoric and policies palatable to the average voter. Our goal is first place after all - Kretschmann showed us how it works in Baden-Württemberg. Let’s present ourselves as a stately new party, ready to govern.
F3: You’re shooting for The Greens to become a sustainable ‘Volkspartei’, it seems. Your rightwards pivot gains mixed reactions, but you did open the door to older generations and even curious Union-voters. This might pay off in the long run, if you can keep up the momentum as Laschet’s alternative.

Q11: June 2021: Finally, you are officially named chancellor candidate by the Green convention. However, the media focuses on something different.</br> Once again, you’ve come under fire for a scandal. This time, it’s about your CV, in which you’ve seemingly amended some passages, due to them being unclear and inaccurate in some parts. The press, of course, takes you to task on this.
A1: The most important points in my CV are accurate. I do apologize for these mistakes and the impression it unwillingly gave, but these errors have all been corrected now. I’ve learned my lesson. We can move on to other topics.
F1: Unfortunately, the media does not move on - instead, they needle you on further inconsistencies that still have to be fixed. First the earnings, now this - the public starts to reconsider its view of you. You come off as sloppy, incompetent even: this image is something you will have to combat, if you want to stay competitive.
A2: This is a non-issue. The main points are there, and this is just a misunderstanding. It’s clear what’s happening here: the media and my opponents are trying to derail our momentum by pushing nonsense-narratives on the only female in the race.
F2: A harsh allegation, although some supporters and leftwing op-eds concur. Overall though, the average voter disagrees with your characterization and starts to seriously doubt your competency. Whatever the reason, your likeability takes a hit, and the narratives derails from the topics you’re popular in, to these unfortunate occurrences.
A3: If you want to see my correct CV, just look at my website - I don’t get what people are getting so upset about. Everything on there is in order, there is no scandal here.
F3: You realize that things like the Wayback machine exist, right? Your CV has been edited multiple times in the last few days. This answer makes you look disingenuous - a small issue about your competency has turned into concerns of your integrity, and your opponents call you out on it.
A4: Oh come on… it was never my goal to embellish my CV, I just made some honest mistakes here. I have to admit, I'm really annoyed with myself for letting this slip through. That said, I’ve followed my responsibility and cleaned this up. I didn’t want to make myself seem greater than I am, and all I can do now is to keep earning your trust.
F4: Your answer seems honest and down-to-earth. Your easy-going approach even earns you laughs and applause at your convention, but the chatter around your misgivings still makes a lot of people doubt your competence for now.

Q12: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbors, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. The lockdowns in the wake of the Covid-pandemic have only made this more salient. What part of the Green program here do you want to emphasize?
A1: The Grand coalition has failed Germany in this regard, as was plain to see during the lockdowns. Under a Green government, we need to invest a lot of resources into modernizing the digital infrastructure of this country - including a right to a fast internet connection.
F1: It’s good to press the attack here - you were part of the opposition in the last decade and can credibly offer change. Particularly rural people are tired of their slow connections and a sluggish bureaucracy around the advancement of fiber-optic infrastructure. Young voters of course appreciate your focus on modern topics.
A2: We need a great European cloud-infrastructure based on Open Source technology, to provide for a great amount of data for the development of AI. We need to invest into AI, to improve Germany as a location for High Tech businesses. We also need regulations around AI usage in art and science.
F2: Many people are wondering why you’re focussing on AI - it doesn’t really register as a big topic in 2021. While experts praise your ambition, most simply do not care about your lofty rhetoric. That said, maybe being prepared here could pay off in the future.
A3: It’s disappointing how much government agencies still rely on old-fashioned methods. We have to invest massively to introduce more modern systems. We need to make non-personalized data public and to introduce a digital identity for every citizen on their phone - of course, protected by good IT-security.
F3: These are some innovative solutions - improving Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is quite popular. However, most parties are calling for some action on this front - your framing does not make you stand out. The FDP meanwhile drives their strategy on this issue in particular.
A4: We need to focus on data protection. Big Tech has to be regulated in its data usage, and our data has to be kept safe from American companies. We will defend the right for privacy, particularly in light of the information unveiled by Edward Snowden.
F4: Although your heart might be in the right place, the Snowden affair was 12 years ago, and is not a particularly important topic in this election. Germans are a bit wary of American companies, but since data protection seems to be a boring topic, most don’t listen to your promises.

Q13: The German Autobahn is currently known for its lack of a speed limit. One often proposed measure to reduce carbon emissions is to change that, as your party has demanded time and time again. Of course, this is quite a contentious topic among carlovers, and yet again, you’re asked about this in an interview.
A1: This is something I will fight for -  we need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h to reduce carbon emissions. We have to hit our emission targets somehow and reducing traffic emissions is one part of that - the situation won’t fix itself.
F1: You’ve stuck to your principles here and strengthened your profile on climate change. A clear and concrete stance is a good thing, although this is divisive - the FDP in particular attacks you sharply. Public opinion seemingly favors you, hopefully this gets reflected at the ballot box.
A2: We need a “safety limit”: A lot of accidents and deaths could be avoided if people wouldn’t be speeding excessively. There are studies showing that with a tempo limit, the number of accidents and traffic victims decrease. This can save lives. It’s a matter of common sense.
F2: The data on this isn’t really conclusive, but your point seems solid to those more critical of the climate argument. While climate change is your defining topic, framing your popular policies like this can help build appeal beyond your base.
A3: We shouldn’t overestimate the effects of a tempo limit on climate change. With this being a divisive topic, we aren’t planning on focusing on this in the next legislative session. However, we will look into introducing new tempo limits on selected highways, as they already exist on certain streets.
F3: This echoes the sentiment of some Realos like Winfried Kretschmann - however your base seems quite deflated by this, and with the SPD and Left party still advocating for a general tempo limit, you seem spineless in the face of conservative critics.
A4: To reach the climate goals for 2030, we need to massively save on CO² in our traffic. We need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h on highways, 80 km/h outside of cities and 30 km/h within city limits - this will have a crucial part in our fight against climate change.
F4: While public opinion seems to be shifting in favor of a 130 km/h tempo limit, the 30 km/h within city limits is still unpopular, especially in the east. While this probably would be helpful for hitting Germany’s emission targets, a hard line like this reinforces The Greens as a predominantly urban party.

EQ4: One salient issue is the topic of pensions, particularly in light of Germany's changing demographics. Currently, pensions are distributed from a fund financed by the current working populace. However, because the number of retirees seems to grow faster than the workforce, the system is thought to be unsustainable. How do you want to address this problem?
A1: The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.
F1: This is a surprisingly conservative answer that disappoints many in your camp. You have criticized the government on its unambitious plans several times, so why not go further here? Younger voters are alienated by your statements, and environmentalists are worried about too permissive building policies.
A2: A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.
F2: You are firmly placed on the left side of the culture wars, but progressive voters interested in your campaign agree with such measures. Of course, the right side of the aisle immediately shoots back with the usual critiques of multiculturalism. You've also avoided talking about government intervention, which might make talks with the FDP easier.
A3: It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.
F3: An expected answer that broadly pleases the left-of-center. While there are always those who stress about fiscal responsibility, this is a strong answer that shows engagement with this topic and provides some popular policies. Older voters usually aren't that Green-inclined, but maybe you can persuade some curious grandparents.
A4: We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.
F4: Pundits detect a pivot to the center, for better or worse. You don't incur a lot of direct criticism, and actually get the attention of some liberals – but your base is confused about how exactly you want to safeguard the social safety net. Your youth wing actually dares to openly question why you’re not going further.

Q14: July 2021: After months of work with your co-author Michael Ebmeyer, you finally published your book: “Jetzt. Wie wir unser Land erneuern”. Partially a biographic work, it provides a general outline for your view on the world. </br> Unfortunately, you’re once again the source of controversy, after allegations of plagiarism; using passages verbatim from internet sources or newspaper articles. The media is once again jumping on this, asking for your comment.
A1: I’ve made some mistakes, yes, but these accusations from some conservative blogger are unfair and completely blown out of proportion. I will get a media lawyer to fight back- this comes close to character-assassination.
F1: Your media lawyer Christian Schertz reasserts your claims, and provides you with a spirited defense. Most experts see you in the right and your party comes to your aid, but the kerfuffle keeps the story in the news cycle. Once again, the race seems to revolve around your misgivings.
A2: It was a mistake to publish the book in its current state and I apologize for this lapse in judgment. My intention was not to deceive anyone, I simply quoted widely available facts, and as this isn’t a scientific paper, I didn’t think a bibliography was necessary. Now, we should keep talking about the issues that matter most.
F2: On its own, this apology might have helped you - but after the earlier discourse around your scandals, more and more people seem to doubt your judgment. You simply come off as careless. A lot of voters seem to give the SPD a second look nowadays, it seems…
A3: This book hasn’t been written by just me, I had a co-author. I’ll make it clear that most of the problematic parts were his responsibility and I didn’t have much to do with them - although I should’ve vetted him a bit better..
F3: Ouch, Annalena! It’s still your name on the cover of the book. Throwing Michael under the bus like this is pretty spiteful, and behind the scenes, even your colleagues ask you to tone it down. Publicly, the story picks up steam, with people seeing through the deflections - your favorability keeps tanking, and Olaf Scholz seems pretty sensible in contrast to you…
A4: What a double standard. This is a popular non-fiction book, not a scientific article. Let’s point to Armin Laschet - in his 2009 book, there are several plagiarized passages, and they’re finding more and more. Why aren’t they talking about that?
F4: While these are clearly deflections, you aren’t alone in the spotlight anymore, as more and more plagiarized passages of his are found. You took the bull by the horns, and in doing so, dragged the race into the mud - laughing at the sidelines stands Olaf Scholz, with a smurfy grin on his face.

EQ5: One of the more salient issues in the current political landscape across the western world is the question of rents, particularly for younger voters. Most economic and educational opportunities increasingly lie in the big cities of the country - where rent is constantly increasing, to the point where it becomes a serious political question. What is your answer to the housing question?
A1: We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.
F1: It seems you really want to commit to making the Greens a ‘Volkspartei’ - such a promise resonates with rural areas, but your base wants to see more action to directly improve the situation by intervening in the market. There are also significant environmental concerns about using more land to build small family homes - not a good look for your profile.
A2: We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards, available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as they do in NRW. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.
F2: This is a classic Realo-like plan to deal with the crisis - although environmentalists are worried that building more might be hurtful to Germany’s ecosystem. To the left’s dismay, you avoid the topic of rent controls, but given similar plans in Berlin were ruled unconstitutional, no one can blame you. ‘Do no harm.’
A3: The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a rent moratorium.
F3: Your party base loves this - the Greens are predominantly urban after all. This should reinforce youth turnout, which can only be good for you. Keep in mind though that a similar plan by your state party in Berlin has been ruled unconstitutional recently, so tread lightly if you actually want to deliver.
A4: Apartments are people's homes, not investments. We can’t afford half measures: we need a federal rent freeze in regions where the capitalist market failed, lower existing costs, if necessary with expropriations. We need new social housing units and the renovation of old buildings - we can even look at legalizing squatting, if it serves the reappropriation of misused spaces.
F4: While some Fundis and the Green Youth appreciate your anti-capitalist pivot, everyone else does not. Many unideological voters looked to the Greens as an interesting new option, transformed from their socialist student-movement past - now they feel like you’ve proven them wrong.

Q15: July 2021: Catastrophe hits. The meteorological low-pressure area <i>Bernd</i> has hit Central Europe and made several rivers burst over their banks. Disastrous rain and floods are affecting large areas of Germany. Particularly endangered seems to be Armin Laschet's homestate, North Rhine-Westphalia. You are currently on vacation while the news breaks - your advisors recommend you to travel to the scenes of disaster instead.
A1: No, it would be improper to try to politicize this catastrophe. I’m going to enjoy my vacation and the time with my family - some small statements over social media and to the press should be enough.
F1: You opt to enjoy your holiday instead - and the press takes note. While your statements are generic enough, your advisors are irritated, as your cold invisibility leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of most voters. However, Laschet gaffes himself - he gets caught boyishly laughing in a press conference with President Steinmeier. Laschet’s Lacher might’ve just saved you from further embarrassment.
A2: My god, of course I will cancel the rest of my vacation! I have to travel to some of the affected regions, to take a look at the carnage myself - but let’s be a bit careful, this is not the time for power games. Let’s do a small press conference with our local Ministers, but no broader media accompaniment or inflammatory statements.
F2: Your humbleness seems appropriate and keeps you out of negative headlines - but as a chancellor candidate, you seem quite invisible these days. But maybe that will pay off: Armin Laschet, by contrast, is caught boyishly laughing in a press conference with President Steinmeier. The criticism on ‘Laschet’s Lacher’ is immense - will you reap the benefits?
A3: You’re right, I need to show my leadership during these tough times. Specifically, I want to meet with Minister of the Environment Anne Spiegel in Rhineland-Palatinate, and visit the Green Party mayors of Bonn and Wuppertal. I’ll publicly observe the devastation and make a public statement alongside the professionals.
F3: Your visits seem appropriate and stately. You get some good pictures in an uncontroversial press coverage, and the locals appreciate your concern.
</br>Meanwhile, Armin Laschet might’ve hit the landmine of this campaign: Laschet’s Lacher. He’s pictured boyishly laughing in a press conference with President Steinmeier.
A4: You’re right, I can’t keep vacationing under these circumstances, but I also don’t want to seem opportunistic. What about a surrogate? Robert is good at talking to people in situations like this. Let’s ask him to go -  I’ll of course still comment on my own.
F4: Robert Habeck is relatable, he’s photogenic, he’s empathetic. He nets some good press - but this just throws fuel on the fire of why you are the candidate, and not him.
</br>Meanwhile, Laschet experiences his worst gaffe so far: Laschet’s Lacher. He’s pictured boyishly laughing in a press conference with President Steinmeier.

Q16: Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear: 220 fatalities, 186 of those in Germany, the deadliest flood since 1962. The topic now changes back to climate change - it seems dire warnings of extreme weather events are starting to come true. As the Green Party, you are expected to make a statement on this.
A1: You know, we haven't been working on this topic since only yesterday. For decades, The Green Party has stood for a stronger stance on environmentalism. Germany is not prepared for the effects of climate change - that’s why we call, for example, for an end of using coal to produce electricity by 2030, as even Markus Söder does.
F1: Some accuse you of wanting to politicize this disaster, but overall, you have the credentials to come out guns blazing here. By siding with Söder, you divide your opposition and reframe the conversation around your preferred topic: climate change. Coal-producing regions of course won’t be happy, but maybe you don’t need those.
A2: I don’t want to come across as wanting to profit from this disaster. After a short, expected mention of climate change, I will primarily talk about basic topics like introducing a better Cell Broadcasting system, a construction ban in areas with high risk of flooding and an overall better national disaster control strategy.
F2: Some are happy about your lack of grandstanding, while others are irritated about how you won’t talk about climate change in the wake of this catastrophe. You avoid a big splash: perhaps, this can establish you as an independent thinker?
A3: I don’t just want to promise climate action, I want to make it concrete. We need to be more ambitious: to that end, I want to produce concrete proposals for centralized action against climate change, as well as unveil a decisive instant-climate-protection-program that we would enact in government.
F3: Polls show, your party has the most credibility on climate issues. Without boasting, the discussion refocuses around your area of expertise - not a bad turn of events. Showing off concrete measures here can improve perceptions of your leadership. Time for a surge?
A4: I want to specifically call out Armin Laschet here - he said that a day like this is no reason to change the politics. What else does he need to see to realize that something must be done? We can’t afford this wish-wash by the Union on climate anymore.
F4: A scathing attack, one that hits the spot. In the wake of this disaster, Laschet is certainly under a lot of heat about his crisis management and tone-deaf statements - keep the attention on his gaffes, and his numbers will surely deflate. Will a negative tone catapult you to the front?

EQ6: Your state chapter in the Saarland seems to have some problems with their list. In a fiery brawl about who should lead the Green list there, after several resignations, former state party chair Hubert Ulrich seemed to have won the top spot against Green Youth chair Jeanne Dillschneider. The result was controversial, with party statutes nominally mandating a woman for the top spot - now, many are calling for action.
A1: We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.
F1: You personally travel to the Saarland in support of Dillschneider. It takes some convincing to the delegates from Ulrich’s district Saarlouis, but in a narrow vote, a list with her at the top is approved and sent to the electoral commission. This whole ordeal took valuable time from your calendar, but you might have averted a crisis here.
A2: We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.
F2: You personally travel to the Saarland in support of Dillschneider. Unfortunately, the re-vote doesn’t change the result. While you have to get back to the campaign trail, in a confusing matter, two lists are submitted - both are rejected by the Electoral Commission. Now the Greens won’t be on the ballot in the Saarland, and your efforts were for naught.
A3: There are certainly more pressing matters than some power plays in the small Saarland. Let them deal with it on their own, I want to concentrate on the national campaign.
F3: The Green Party of the Saarland holds a re-vote, excluding several delegates from Ulrichs district Saarlouis, so Dillschneider wins. Unfortunately, the electoral commission rules this procedure undemocratic and rejects their list - this means The Greens won’t be on the ballot in the Saarland! Hopefully the difference is small enough to not matter.
A4: Let’s not get derailed - make them change the statutes so Ulrich can stay in the top spot. The delegates democratically voted for him, so we’ll have to accept this result. We can deal with anything further after the election.
F4: This is a pragmatic move, and your intervention ends the argument with a change in the statues. However, giving up on The Greens’ long standing ideal of parity in their lists rankles many true believers, including Dillschneider, who retreats personally offended. The whole affair is sure to deflate enthusiasm, particularly in the Green Youth.

Q17: It’s now less than two months until the election, and the campaign is heating up. It’s time to hit <b>The Campaign Trail</b>! In your travels around the country, what region do you want to focus your efforts on over the next few weeks?
A1: Robert Habeck is currently on a pretty popular tour across the North Sea coast. Let’s join him to show the unity of our party and produce some great pictures of us as the ‘dynamic duo’!
F1: Your chemistry is as good as ever. You provide for some nice pictures on the North Sea coast, visiting North Frisia and Sylt, the Lower Saxon coast as well as a monumental rally in leftist Hamburg. Some people might still feel “Habeck-envy”, but by tying yourself closer to him, his popularity might just carry over.
A2: Winfried Kretschman, the only Green Minister-President, has just won his reelection this spring and is very popular, particularly among moderates and conservatives. In order to broaden our appeal and show off competent Green governance, I want to campaign with him in Baden-Württemberg and South Germany in general.
F2: Kretschmann repeatedly showcased a recipe to win a general election as a Green - and your party has surprisingly good polling numbers in the South. By reaching out to moderate conservationists you might be able to catch the Söder-crowd right from under Laschet's feet.
A3: I’m quite content with our polling numbers in West Germany, but we are still far behind in East Germany. I don’t just want to be perceived as a chancellor of the west - to not get completely pummeled there, I want to focus my visits on the New States, to make them feel heard and activate traditional non-voters.
F3: The Greens are traditionally not very strong in the East, although half their official name stems from the former East German party <i>Alliance 90</i>. There are some promising enclaves in the big university cities, but the question remains if your message can reach into the disengaged countryside.
A4: The states of Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have their state elections parallel to our federal elections. To further our standing as a national party, a good result is crucial there. As such, let’s campaign with our top candidates, Bettina Jarasch and Anne Shepley, to show off the strength of Green women!
F4: While you aren’t casting a broad net here, you do project strength, and the two candidates appreciate your help. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, you showcase your opposition to Nord Stream 2. Berlin is a traditional Green stronghold: you receive a heroes’ welcome in Kreuzberg.

Q18: August 2021: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. What should be done about that in your opinion?
A1: If everyone has gotten an offer for a vaccine, we shouldn’t rule out that vaccinated people might be able to do more than the unvaccinated. It can’t be that the freedoms of everyone are getting restricted because some don’t want to get the shot.
F1: Over time, this has been the preferred stance of most people - but it’s still a bit controversial on the political stage. There are concerns about this leading to a two-class society.
A2: We are doing a lot to get everyone vaccinated right now without thinking about the consequences. What if the vaccine is toxic? We shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead.
F2: There is a tiny fragment of society - the “natural medicine” crowd - that forms a swing voter block between Greens and AfD. Your stance appeals to those people - and those people only. Your party has to do damage control and forces you to retract, but among the catastrophic fallout, they are seriously considering switching you out for Habeck. </br> Tread lightly.
A3: Mandatory vaccinations aren’t easy to implement - but we have to think of the alternatives. If our children have to undergo further lockdowns, we will need a general vaccine mandate in Germany, to protect them and those who did everything they could to uphold our medical system.
F3: A vaccine mandate is pretty divisive. Your core voter base is open to this, but the majority still seems opposed. It unnerves liberals and young people in particular  - and, of course, you’re stirring the right-wing fear monger pot.
A4: Overall, we are on the right path with the vaccination campaign. We need to do more to reach everyone though, including mobile vaccination teams that can provide coverage to areas with low vaccination rates.
F4: Your answer is uncontroversial, and your proposal proves to be quite popular. You’re still in the opposition and can’t affect a lot of policy, but dodging controversies might just be enough.

EQ7: A bit of a minor issue, but one that has gripped the imagination of many young voters is the topic of cannabis. Currently, it is a controlled substance, and illegal to produce, distribute or own. In light of worldwide movements to decriminalize or even legalize it: <i>Wann Bubatz legal</i>?
A1: Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.
F1: People detect a bit of a centrist pivot here. The Greens have been championing decriminalization and legalization throughout the last decade, and your new “small-step”-approach is certainly more careful than expected - activists are disappointed. Here’s hoping the inroads with suburban parents are worth it.
A2: We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.
F2: Many advised you to pivot to the center, to establish the Greens as a ‘Volkspartei’ - but this isn’t what they meant! Your oddly conservative stance gets a load of media attention, and your colleagues are horrified - individualism is a core tenet of the Greens! Shortly after you are forced to retract, and it’s embarrassing.
A3: Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.
F3: This has been a pet issue of Green activists for years, and as times are changing, many feel like with you as chancellor, there’s finally real hope for cannabis reform. Your reassurance energizes them and endears you to many younger voters, who you need to turn out. They’re certainly hoping for a “green” future.
A4: We don’t just want to legalize Cannabis, but also decriminalize small amounts of hard party drugs like XTC, cocaine and amphetamines. The criminalization of drug consumers is a relic from the last century, the ‘right for intoxication’ should be self-evident.
F4: Been to the <i>Berghain</i> one too many times, Annalena? This stance is one discussed only in your party's urban chapters, and isn’t acceptable to even a majority of Greens. Scholz and Laschet immediately jump on your eccentric comments - journalists discuss how the Greens might not be ready to lead after all.

Q19:  Early in the campaign, it looked like you were the woman that could beat Laschet and  deliver a new era not just for The Greens, but also Germany. But as people increasingly look at the polling, they become doubtful. Voters are seemingly starting to give Olaf Scholz and the SPD a second look, providing him with a dramatic surge at the end of this race - at your cost.
A1: I’m very concerned about this development. We need to become more visible, and turn some heads towards Scholz’ own vulnerabilities. In the next few weeks, I will focus on attacking him and his party on their broken promises and shady dealings like cum-ex and Wirecard.
F1: Your aggressive strategy gets you back into the headlines, and drags down Scholz’s favorabilities. You blunt his surge - but now, all three candidates have low numbers. This might be bad for turnout - and good for the CDU, whose voters seem to go to the polls no matter what.
A2: Of course, I’m very disappointed about this. However, honestly, we are still very likely going to be part of the next government and I’d rather govern with Scholz than with Laschet. I don’t want to jeopardize this: instead, the two men won’t be able to refrain from attacks, and I'll calmly rise above the pack.
F2: Cutting your losses? While Laschet does get more aggressive towards Scholz, the Vice Chancellor just doesn’t lose his calm. Through your inaction, all that might be left now, is hope. That said, Scholz publicly said that you’re his preferred coalition partner: maybe change can be enacted as a junior-partner as well…
A3: That’s too bad, but this is no time to get disheartened because of numbers. We know we are fighting for the right thing - let’s motivate ourselves and reinvent this campaign, new rallies, new posters, more media interviews: that way, we can heighten our visibility and draw a good contrast to Scholz’s unwavering borefest.
F3: The thing is, people like Scholz’s boringness. They find him comfortable and stately, and most agree that he would be a good chancellor. That said, the media applauds you for your energized youthful rallies and you increasingly become more visible again- the bleeding stops, though you’ll still have a lot of work to do.

Q20: A staple for every election season is the topic of taxes. </br>The Greens have an ambitious program with quite a few investments, particularly on climate change. Many people, particularly fiscal conservatives, wonder how you want to finance all those programs. In your next interview you’re asked frankly: do you want to raise taxes to achieve that?
A1: To finance necessary government spending, taxes on the rich have to be raised. We should reinstate the wealth tax and raise the income tax, but in a way that leaves small and medium-income earners unaffected.
F1: This is a good, progressive answer to motivate your base.<br>Your position is broadly popular on the left spectrum and respected by lower income voters, but you don’t do much to differentiate yourself.
A2: Effectively combating climate change is our number one priority, and to finance this, there might have to be certain tax increases on goods like meat or dairy. The wealthy will of course have to bear the highest increase, but everyone will have to contribute more - if we invest in our future, the financial effort will come back manifold.
F2: As much as you’re trying to spin this, you’re still promising to raise taxes. This might be sound economically, but people are worried that your plans might be too costly and might make animal products unaffordable. Parties to your right have an easy route of attack, while the left accuses you of indifference towards less affluent people.
A3: We need to raise taxes on the rich a bit, yes. However, more importantly, we need to abandon the ‘Black Zero’ and reform the debt ceiling in our constitution. It is economically sound to invest in certain projects, especially considering the current interest rates.
F3: This is a sound argument that’s supported by Keynesian economists with broader appeal to the voters you have to win. However, since a 2/3rds majority and approval by the states is needed to modify the constitution, you’ll certainly be dependent on the SPD and even the CDU to carry through after the election.
A4: Climate action doesn’t have to be expensive; particularly policies friendly to innovation, tax rebates for eco-friendly technologies and a higher CO²-price in emission trading can help us combat climate change without high expenditures. Of course, we are proposing more than that, but we’re sure that noticeable tax increases can be avoided.
F4: This sounds like a veiled offer to the FDP - who usually sits on the other side of the economic debate. Are The Greens undergoing a paradigm shift? After your fruitful alliance in the opposition, people seem to notice a small love affair between Greens and Liberals. Of course, SPD and The Left immediately take you to task on this, while Fundis are unnerved.

Q21: There are 7 parties poised to enter parliament, and none has ever won an absolute majority since Adenauer in 1957. As such, it is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. Particularly salient are Laschets attacks that you would govern with the socialist party Die Linke, equating their radicalism with the AfD. As such, you are asked ad-nauseam - who would you enter a coalition with?
A1: We need to send the Union back to the opposition - they are the party of standstill. While we definitely advocate for a stricter line on climate change, the party we have the most overlap with is the SPD. In the end, maybe it’ll even be enough for an alliance solely between Green and Red.
F1: It’s true that the SPD and Greens are each other's preferred coalition partners, even looking back to 7 years of Red-Green under Gerhard Schröder. However, the party system of Germany has changed, and most think it improbable that there will be a two-party-majority for the both of you - meanwhile, you’re dodging the question of cooperating with Die Linke.
A2: While we of course disavow any cooperation with the AfD, I also can not imagine a good working relationship with Die Linke. I want to see an administration that takes responsibility in the world - if we don’t share common ground on foreign policy, there is no basis for a government.
F2: With this strong statement, you’re driving a harsher lane than Scholz, effectively silencing Laschet's attacks on you. This is certain to gather points among moderates, for many of whom this question was a hold-up to supporting you, but you also disappoint many younger voters and left-wingers in your base by disavowing leftist unity so frankly.
A3: Equating Die Linke with the far right AfD, as the CDU does, is wildly dangerous. The best path to real change in our government lies in a cooperation of the three leftist parties: such an arrangement has worked in several states already, so I’m certain we can find compromises on contentious topics.
F3: This plays right into Laschet's criticisms of you, and no matter how you spin it, it frightens moderates fearful of the successor-party of the SED. On the other hand, Die Linke is hot on finally entering into a federal government - but their anti-interventionist stance is hard to ignore. Maybe your clear advances can help soften them up.
A4: This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition.
F4: You’ve taken a liking to the “Pasta-connection” of 2019, it seems. The FDP is more hesitant to reciprocate, but your message is clear - you’re looking for a Jamaica or a Traffic Light coalition. Since Die Linke might be hard to bargain with, this could be a cunning move of Realpolitik - just know, Lindner prefers the CDU as a partner.

EQ8: A defining social issue is the question of abortion. Currently, criminal law §218 disallows abortions generally, but decriminalizes them in case of rape, or if the pregnancy is under 12 weeks old. Additionally, §219a establishes an “ad ban” for doctors offering abortions. You’re asked for your stance on this controversial topic.
A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: Cautious, but realistic and solution-oriented. Feminism is one of the core tenets of Green politics, and your answer satisfies most advocates. The uncontroversial nature of this answer keeps the issue out of the limelight - that could be good, as conservatives concerned about climate change might still be in play for you.
A2: We want to strike $218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: A steadfast progressive answer with credibility: your party has advocated for this all the way back in 1980! You remain the preferred option of feminists in this race - but keep in mind this might fuel a counter reaction from the right. Your stance is also slightly to the left of Scholz’, which might be useful, depending on your strategy.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: Why are you running in the first place, if it’s ‘fine as is’? Look, even if you want to keep the conversation on climate change, don’t contradict the overwhelming majority of your own party! After all, the Greens were born from the New Social Movements of the 60’s and 70’s - feminism is a core tenet of Green politics. Many women are disappointed.
A4: We need to immediately strike § 218 and $ 219 - instead, the right to free, simple and accessible abortions has to be guaranteed; state-built hospitals should be required to perform the procedure. Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance.
F4: A strong stance that pivots leftwards - you really seem to gamble that by dragging culture wars into this race, you can consolidate the left around you. Your internet presence is already under siege from right-wing trolls. That said, your language echoes that of Die Linke in 2017, which might open you up to more attacks from the center.


Q22: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. Many loyal locals are left behind, as the Taliban are poised to make a comeback. The government is sharply criticized for its botched evacuation - what tone do you want to strike for your campaign in the wake of this situation?
A1: Weeks ago, The Greens proposed to get local German staff to safety, but SPD and Union refused. The entire German Federal government, be it Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor have politically decided to prioritize internal political motives over our German foreign policy responsibilities. Both parties are at fault.
F1: You seem to gamble that joining the mudslinging is worth it - given how you really are the only major candidate whose party wasn’t involved in this tragedy, you might have a point. Hopefully, this can still translate at the ballot box in a few weeks.
A2: In these minutes, what counts is saving lifes. Now is not the time for electoral campaigns or demands for resignations - now, we need to do everything we can to bring the people who protected our soldiers to safety.
F2: While you’re probably a lot more outraged in private, for your campaign, you’re apparently building on calming emotions and strategic consideration. While CDU and SPD blame each other for the failure, maybe your candor will be noted positively.
A3: Only a few days before the fall of Kabul, Minister of the Interior Seehofer wanted to keep deporting people to Afghanistan. There are dozens of women’s rights advocates, children and families that we need to get out, take them in as refugees! We need to organize a summit of all NATO-members and Afghanistan’s neighbors to that end, now!
F3: This is a full-throated defense of a progressive refugee policy that’s appreciated by most of your voters. With several CDU and CSU politicians warning of another 2015, the battlelines are clearly set - although it’s unclear how realistic your plan is to get these people out of the country.
A4: The Green Party is a party of pacifism, and we’ve been against this war in Afghanistan from the start. While the pictures are tragic and we need to do what we can to help, this whole episode shows why we shouldn’t get involved in these types of conflicts.
F4: The Green Party voted for the Afghanistan mission and was even part of the government in 2001. This is oddly non-interventionist for a foreign policy expert like you - has Die Linke convinced you? Either way, your statement is promptly attacked from all sides as both unproductive and factually false.

Q23: September 2021: Official TV debates are a relatively recent phenomenon in Germany, only being consistently organized since 2002. Now, for the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Olaf Scholz and Armin Laschet are all invited. What is going to be your strategy?
A1: Scholz has slowly climbed his way up again - he’s clearly the biggest obstacle to our success. Let’s focus on taking him down to take back the center-left lane.
F1: Scholz has certainly outperformed expectations. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - let’s hope you can consolidate the left around you.
A2: This country needs a change in government, and Laschet is a vulnerable candidate. Let’s take him down once and for all and win this election!
F2: While he’s still the favorite for many, he is your main opponent, and his many flaws might make him an easy target. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - time to rip the CDU a new one.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America.
F3: An optimistic pitch could rekindle the enthusiasm around your candidacy and to give you that last burst of momentum. People like concrete soundbites - let’s hope taking the high road helps you stand out!
A4: The media has constantly discriminated against myself and my party. This debate will be biased towards the old, establishment parties, while those who advocate for change won’t be treated fairly. I refuse to participate!
F4: Many question your judgment. The debate goes ahead without you - the Triell becomes another duel between SPD and CDU, as it was in the past. Meanwhile, you might just have relegated the Greens back to the status of a minor party. The duopoly between the Social Democrats and the Union reasserts itself, as Scholz takes away the win against Laschet.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. There are plenty of avenues to attack him and stun his momentum - which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: Olaf Scholz is the incumbent vice chancellor of the GroKo for the last four years: he’s complicit in the political standstill of this country.  People who want real change in this country have to look elsewhere!
F1: Despite you competing for the same voters, Scholz didn’t expect an attack from you - however, his disavowal of a continuation of the GroKo defuses your criticism a bit. Laschet gets tempted to defend the Status Quo - but in polling afterwards, it’s clear how change is in the air. Both Scholz and you get good grades.
A2: I want to hit him on his scandals, both as finance minister and earlier. He mishandled the Wirecard collapse, was involved in the cum-ex banking scandal and had a disastrous response to the G20 meeting when he was mayor of Hamburg.
F2: Laschet starts the debate by hitting Scholz on the Wirecard affair - and you keep piling it on. Under these circumstances, the Vice Chancellor clearly gets evasive and vague. However, most regard Laschet as the more aggressive questionnaire here, and you seem a bit invisible by comparison. His strategy seems to pay off, as he holds an edge in polling.
A3: While we might agree on social or financial topics, the SPD is a hindrance in our fight against climate change. Scholz doesn’t even want to credibly speed up our exit from coal - 2038 is too late! These reactive politics are not progressive, and have to be voted out!
F3: Leftist infighting, a classic - but this time, it might pay off. Scholz tries to dodge your attacks with platitudes, but you keep pressing. He seems ignorant, and with Laschet naturally weak on this issue, you reemphasize the battlelines. You’ve clearly defined yourself as the candidate for climate action, and your potential voters nod along.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a progressive to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. Your repeated rattling down of your policies doesn’t really resonate, while the other candidates ignore you. You disappear into the background in what clearly becomes a duel between Scholz and Laschet, in which the Vice Chancellor prevails.
EQ9: Along with the <i> Triell </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i> Vierkampf </i>. While you have eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Alexander Dobrindt of the CSU, the smaller sister of the Union, debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, considering the polling.
A2: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If they match or surpass their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Alexander Dobrindt made a surprisingly strong case for Laschet as the pragmatic heir of the Merkel era. This might help the CSU solidify its historical dominance in Bavaria, but it also garners some goodwill for the CDU chancellor candidate.
A4: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…

Q25: The 26th of September is almost here. This has been a wild ride, and come what may, the Greens will have had a moment that will be talked about years from now. Hopefully, it hasn’t passed yet! In the final days of the campaign, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: Luisa Neubauer, the famous Fridays For Future activist, is a member of our party, but she’s been inactive. Maybe we can change that - I want to ask her to appear with us, in an official statement of support. I want to speak to the German youth that brought us where we are today, in some rallies all across Germany’s cities.
F1: Unfortunately, she refers to FFF’s party neutrality and refuses to appear with you, although she appreciates the outreach. Instead, you’re doing your rallies with an assortment of longtime Green heavyweights like Claudia Roth, Anton Hofreiter and Jürgen Trittin. Now, time to join your family in Potsdam and hope that voters are just as “Ready, because you are”.
A2: If there is one Green name that’s as important as mine these days it’s “Robert Habeck”. For the whole campaign, Robert was a loyal compatriot. We are the faces of our party, and with his outstanding people-skills, I want to rally with him to show what the Greens have to offer, all across Northern Germany.
F2: Robert is still broadly popular, especially in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein. Although some (including him) are still wistful about “chancellor Habeck”, your youthful dynamic on stage makes many voters curious about a Green-led government. Now, enjoy some time with your family in Potsdam, and let’s hope they’re “Ready, because you are”.
A3: There will be state elections in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern parallel to the federal elections. To project confidence and strength, I want to appear with Bettina Jarasch in Berlin to help make her the second Green head of state government. This is only the beginning of a Green decade in Europe!
F3: Jarasch is happy that you’re helping in her efforts to turn the capital Green. Berlin is already a stronghold for your party, and you can be certain to pick up some more direct mandates there - maybe it’ll even extend to yours, since Potsdam is right nearby. It’s only a small trip home to your family: let’s hope Germany is “Ready, because you are”.
A4: Winfried Kretschmann is the only Green Minister-President and a very important figure of the Realo-wing. If we want to win this thing, we’ll have to reach out towards the center, and he knows how. Let’s ask him to appear with us across South Germany.
F4: The <i>Minischderbräsident</i> of Baden-Württemberg is positively surprised, but campaigns enthusiastically for your cause. Hopefully, this can net you some strong results in both urban and rural regions of the South. Now, it’s time to head home to your family in Potsdam, and hope the median voter is “Ready, because you are”.

Q26: The CDU/CSU had a massive scandal with some of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks earlier this year, while SPD chancellor candidate Scholz has been sharply criticized for his role in a cum-ex scheme of the Warburg Bank and the collapse of financial service provider Wirecard. As you find yourself their equal, do you plan to capitalize on this?
A1: I trust the German people to choose the most competent candidate and party. I believe this campaign is won on the issues, and as such, I want to be optimistic and future-oriented, instead of divisive.
F1: For your likeability, this might be safer. However, some media outlets perceive you as somewhat invisible - some bombast couldn’t hurt your campaign. At least Laschet and Scholz will be easier to talk to later on.
A2: The Green Party has always been in favor of more transparency. We need a ban on lobbying for money and a mandatory lobby register by law where all side earnings and -activities are publicized in full! We also need stricter rules for MP’s with regard to stock trading.
F2: These are some concrete steps that are well received among the populace. The Greens, including you, certainly have a cleaner image on this front, and embody change from the backroom politics of the Union.
A3: Yes, I need to press the attack. Looking at the extent of this affair it’s obvious that there is a structural and systemic problem in the CDU/CSU. For decades it seems to be a custom for their MP’s to earn plenty of income through their mandate!
F3: A scathing critique, but on such an issue, it’s warranted. Keeping the attention on your opponents misgivings is always worth it, but don’t poison the well for a potential coalition agreement too much.
A4: We need to take Olaf Scholz down a notch. Both as mayor of Hamburg and as Finance Minister, he has been involved in shady dealings around the Warburg Bank’s cum-ex trading and the Wirecard affair. He’s saying he “can’t remember”! We have to ask questions about his own personal integrity if he’s unwilling to explain himself.
F4: The allegations against Scholz are a bit murky, but the public gets the message. Remember, the SPD is close to you politically, and dishing out attacks on his character could jeopardize your cooperation. Let’s hope Scholz won’t take off the velvet gloves concerning your candidacy.

Q27: As the election comes closer, many voters are giving you a closer look. A big hold-up for many people to vote for the Greens is their perceived elitism. Your path in life seemingly doesn’t refute this: After university, you’ve gone pretty much straight into politics, without working a “normal job”. It may seem trite, but to voters of lower education, this seems out of touch. How do you plan to address this?
A1: I don’t have anything to lose here, so let’s lean into this. I’ve studied Political Science and International Law - what else could have prepared me better for the position of German chancellor?
F1: You’ve bolstered the credentials around your education, but they haven’t really stood to question. Furthermore, there seems to be confusion around what exactly your degree is, and why you’ve canceled your dissertation. The whole discourse really doesn’t help your image.
A2: While I might not have the practical experience, I am a working mother of two elementary school children. I want to emphasize that part of my biography more, so people will see me as more approachable.
F2: While your family is a bit wary about the personal nature of this race, this approach works well enough. People sympathize with your lifestyle and it particularly strengthens your credentials on family- and education policy. There are a few conservatives who are murmuring, but let’s be real - you don’t want to win those.
A3: This is a problem all parties in the Bundestag struggle with - there are many more people with a college degree than without in our parliament. We all have to work together to change this.
F3: You’re not wrong, but the Greens are a big offender here - 85% in your party group are from a higher education, 12% didn’t even finish their degree. While you’re praised to have recognized the problem, you’ll have to do some convincing why you are the one qualified to change this.
A4: I reject the notion that you must have personally experienced something to find the right answers. The point of representative democracy is to choose politicians to represent the people, they don’t have to be like them.
F4: This deflection doesn’t really come off well. Voters with lower education mostly disagree with you. It’s not a big deal in this election, but at the margins, their votes could be important.

Q28: July 2021: After months of work with your co-author Michael Ebmeyer, you finally published your book: “Jetzt. Wie wir unser Land erneuern”. Partially a biographic work, it provides a general outline for your view on the world. </br> Unfortunately, it’s a source of controversy, namely, plagiarism. You’re accused of using passages verbatim from internet sources or newspaper articles. The media is asking for your comment.
A1: I’ve made some mistakes, yes, but these accusations from some conservative blogger are unfair and completely blown out of proportion. I will get a media lawyer to fight back- this comes close to character-assassination.
F1: Your media lawyer Christian Schertz reasserts your claims, and provides you with a spirited defense. Most experts see you in the right and your party comes to your aid, but the kerfuffle keeps the story in the news cycle.
A2: It was a mistake to publish the book in its current state and I apologize for this lapse in judgment. My intention was not to deceive anyone, I simply quoted widely available facts, and as this isn’t a scientific paper, I didn’t think a bibliography was necessary. Now, we should keep talking about the issues that matter most.
F2: The apology is sufficient for most, and although some wonder if you’re really ready for the spotlight, some revelations around plagiarism in a book Laschet wrote quickly shuts down the discourse around you.
A3: This book hasn’t been written by just me, I had a co-author. I’ll make it clear that most of the problematic parts were his responsibility and I didn’t have much to do with them - although I should’ve vetted him a bit better..
F3: Ouch, Annalena! It’s still your name on the cover of the book. Throwing Michael under the bus like this is pretty spiteful, and behind the scenes, even your colleagues ask you to tone it down. Publicly, the story picks up steam, with people seeing through the deflections - your favorability noticeably tanks, and people are giving Scholz a second look…
A4: What a double standard. This is a popular non-fiction book, not a scientific article. Let’s point to Armin Laschet - in his 2009 book, there are several plagiarized passages, and they’re finding more and more. Why aren’t they talking about that?
F4: While these are clearly deflections, the discourse does shift towards Laschet a bit, as more and more plagiarized passages of his are found. You took the bull by the horns, and in doing so, dragged the race into the mud - laughing at the sidelines stands Olaf Scholz, who seeks to gain from your confrontations…

Q29: After months of work with your co-author Michael Ebmeyer, you finally published your book: “Jetzt. Wie wir unser Land erneuern”. Partially a biographic work, it provides a general outline for your view on the world. You have put a lot of energy into finishing this manifesto - how do you plan to use it in your campaign?
A1: I want to promote the book on every rally and give out copies at a discounted price. We need to return to broader visions in politics, and I’m hoping people can follow mine if I’ll make it more available to my voters.
F1: Most people who are interested in your book are intrigued by your candidacy already, but this could endear them sustainably to your Green ideology. There are some complaints that the book is light on specific policies, but overall, it is quite well-received and helps get the message out.
A2: I want to point towards the book as a serious contribution to the most important policy debate this country has right now. I’ll send copies to journalists and intellectuals so they can review the book - a good bout of media coverage is what we need right now.
F2: Not a bad plan, but unfortunately, your book is just too lightweight for this strategy to work, despite the effort you’ve put into it. It gets mixed reviews from critics who expected something more complex and concrete on the details. It’s sure to rally academics already invested in your candidacy, though.
A3: Showing it off like this could hurt my image as being sensationalist or something. I’ll announce that it has been published, but I more so want it to serve in the background as a referral if anyone is further interested in how I’m thinking.
F3: No harm, no foul - the book is certain to not have a big impact on your electoral strategy after all. Maybe that’s for the best, because let’s be real, people don’t read anymore.

Q30: August 2021: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. What should be done about that in your opinion?
A1: If everyone has gotten an offer for a vaccine, we shouldn’t rule out that vaccinated people might be able to do more than the unvaccinated. It can’t be that the freedoms of everyone are getting restricted because some don’t want to get the shot.
F1: Over time, this has been the preferred stance of most people - but it’s still a bit controversial on the political stage. There are concerns about this leading to a two-class society.
A2: We are doing a lot to get everyone vaccinated right now without thinking about the consequences. What if the vaccine is toxic? We shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead.
F2: There is a tiny fragment of society - the “natural medicine” crowd - that forms a swing voter block between Greens and AfD. Your stance appeals to those people - and those people only. Your party has to do damage control and forces you to retract, but among the catastrophic fallout, they are seriously considering switching you out for Habeck. </br> Tread lightly.
A3: Mandatory vaccinations aren’t easy to implement - but we have to think of the alternatives. If our children have to undergo further lockdowns, we will need a general vaccine mandate in Germany, to protect them and those who did everything they could to uphold our medical system.
F3: A vaccine mandate is pretty divisive. Your core voter base is open to this, but the majority still seems opposed. It unnerves liberals and young people in particular  - and, of course, you’re stirring the right-wing fear monger pot.
A4: Overall, we are on the right path with the vaccination campaign. We need to do more to reach everyone though, including mobile vaccination teams that can provide coverage to areas with low vaccination rates.
F4: Your answer is uncontroversial, and your proposal proves to be quite popular while setting you apart from other parties.

Q31: Throughout the campaign, Olaf Scholz and the SPD have tried to find their footing in the political landscape once more - but the momentum of your candidacy seems to have relegated them to the sidelines after all, at least for now. With the oldest party of Germany ailing away, what will be your strategy for the final few weeks of the campaign?
A1: With the Social Democrats demotivated as they are, we can set our sights onto Laschet. I’m gonna emphasize how we need change in our government as well as show off our commitment to lead a sensible government.
F1: After Laschet’s famous gaffe during the floods, you really do seem capable and sympathetic by contrast. Scholz has pretty much been neglected by the media for weeks - with him mostly out of the way, it’s up to you now to carry that sentiment all the way to the ballot box.
A2: It’s a good sign for us that the SPD is down in polls - but they’re still a formidable voting block. Their voters should be the easiest to win over - let’s target them specifically by emphasizing our socio-economic program, to consolidate the center-left around us.
F2: Most of your success does stem from voters who would’ve voted SPD before, and continuing that line to deliver the coup-de-grace might just hoist you over the top. However, be reminded that purely by its cultural impact, the core voter base of the SPD might stay loyal to their political home all the way to the end.
A3: It looks like Die Linke might struggle to reach the 5%-hurdle. I am clearly the best option for a leftist government - by pressing on this issue, we could keep them out of government and simplify finding a majority. Maybe it’ll even be enough for Green-Red!
F3: A lot of the core voters of Die Linke are unabashed socialists, but by gnawing at their margins, you really could knock them out of the Bundestag - as long as they don’t win a third direct mandate outside of Berlin. Let’s see if your gambit pays off.
A4: They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings.
F4: Your motives are admirable, but there are probably no two parties that have as little overlap as you and the AfD. Your attacks galvanize the Alternative’s base and hold little electoral potential in store.

Q32: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Armin Laschet, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and chancellor candidate of the CDU. He is a vulnerable candidate, having been criticized on many gaffes like Laschet’s Lacher. What do you want to emphasize?
A1: Mr. Laschet’s crisis responses are erratic and unreliable. He can not hold a clear line on Covid, he can not stand up to pressure and corruption from his own party, and his response to the disastrous floods this summer shows that he lacks the temperament to be a good chancellor. Germany deserves someone better than him.
F1: A pretty harsh tone that leaves Laschet unable to ignore these attacks. Your blows fly quite low and dominate the media chatter, but as voters get reminded of his numerous gaffes and the mask scandals earlier this year, the bad press for the CDU chair continues. Meanwhile, the “temperament” of Olaf Scholz in particular gets good grades.
A2: How convenient that the Union pivots to social policies only when we’re talking about fighting climate change. Mr. Laschet has to realize that the Paris agreement isn’t voluntary! He does not provide any new concepts on climate action, he’s just always “against”. This attitude is hurting Germany’s industrial future!
F2: A biting critique of Laschet’s record. While he tries counters with his own proposals, calling your concepts “prohibitory policies”, the environment is still mostly your turf. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz does his own thing, playing to his strengths as a calm statesman - polls show a tie between your performances, with Laschet barely behind.
A3: For the last 16 years, this country has been governed by the CDU/CSU, and they are out of ideas on what to do in government. Armin Laschet is the candidate of standstill politics: he is against more investments and against the duly needed modernization of Germany. When we look at the unchanged problems in our country - I think it’s time for change.
F3: If anyone can make this attack, it’s you. Laschet rejects your allegations, but embraces the label of a “continuity-candidate”. Fortunately, your pitch for real change resonates - and the aggressive manner in which you’re pushing for it defines the debate. People found you strong, assertive and authentic, while the men on stage seemed lame. Nice!
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a progressive to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. Your repeated rattling down of your policies doesn’t really resonate, while the other candidates ignore you. You disappear into the background in what clearly becomes a duel between Scholz and Laschet, in which the Vice Chancellor prevails.

Q33: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the Green program, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: The CDU/CSU has been in government for 16 years, the SPD for 8. There are only two options - will we duck behind the continuity of the Grand Coalition of CDU and SPD, or will we accomplish real change?  We are far behind on many issues - it’s time for a Green chancellorship!
F1: Your pitch is received decently by viewers and pundits alike. However, the aggressive tone of Laschet and Scholz’ unwavering calmness dominate the media cycle in the coming days. Olaf Scholz seems the most competent to many, and despite your efforts, you’re treated like a third wheel.
A2: There is one issue that really matters in this election: Climate change! I’m the only one to have a program that’s ambitious enough to truly make a difference. I will not keep making half-measures on climate action like the Grand Coalition: the next government has to be a climate-government.
F2: Your plea is passionate and authentic, but perhaps, also expected. Laschet of course attacks you on your more controversial policies, while Scholz somewhat concurs with you, mostly keeping to himself. Viewers aren’t really sure who they agreed with the most, and the result of the Triell seems to be an uneventful three-way tie. At least you’re keeping up.
A3: I’d like to focus on our social policies. It’s not the fault of climate action that people get paid too little, that the minimum wage is too low and that every fifth child lives in poverty. That’s because of policies that intend to mainly relieve high-earners and which do not look at poverty in Germany.
F3: You tear into Laschet’s economic plans, but so does Scholz, although a bit less aggressively. The narrative of the Triell seems to mostly revolve around the ideological rift: unfortunately, flanked by two Leftists, Laschet can define himself as a sensible centrist. It’s close, but he manages to consolidate Merkel’s coalition around him for a win in the polls.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. These old white men need someone to tell them how it is. Years and years of standstill, and these just won’t admit that we need change. Someone has to stand up and fight!
F4: You seem to let your frustrations get the best of you. You throw around attacks on Laschet’s character and call Scholz disingenuous, and even call out the narratives around you as “blatantly sexist”. Your opponents ignore your attacks, and while many of your followers are happy about your brutal honesty, most voters at home seem embarrassed.

Extra visits final Q
A5: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the Greens have a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F5: Merz competently rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show some backbone and confidence to your party. Now, it’s time now to huddle down in your home in Potsdam, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Ready, because you are”.
A6: Okay, hear me out. This campaign needs a wildcard. This whole time, the Greens are always portrayed as “woke” or something. We could really turn some heads if we show that we’re serious about my pivot on refugees, and there’s only one person in our party who could do that: Boris Palmer.
F6: Annalena, that’s, that’s a joke… right? …no? Alright shit, Michael, it’s too late to swap in Habeck now, just give her the appearance and we’ll try to bury it. What, the media already got wind of it? Oh god… okay, Annalena, play it off as “reconciliation” and “talking with everyone”, okay? Those media people will rip you a new one… better hope they’re “Ready, because you are”...

Extra answer for Q8
A4: This is simply not as much of a big deal as people make of it. I don’t even get an income as party chair. These payments, while I should’ve reported them, are small peanuts, and the parliament hasn’t even asked me to report them, I did that on my own initiative. Frankly, these criticisms smell like sexism!
F4: You actually dare to say the quiet part out loud. While it’s true that people are certainly treating you differently from the other candidates, your deflections don’t come off well to the average voter. Sexism or not, your favorability numbers take a hit, especially in the wake of your outburst.

Extra answer for Q29
A4: Not only that, I want to show off the plethora of ideas that The Greens are putting up. Robert wrote a phenomenal book called “Von hier an anders: Eine politische Skizze”, and I want him to show his work off prominently as well.
F4: Your literary strategy does you some favors among people of higher education - but that’s a voter block you certainly don’t have problems with. Everyone else doesn’t really care, in fact, it makes you seem a bit elitist…

Richtungsfrage Links
EQ3: There’s been some media chatter, even fear mongering about you in the press. Even though you’re traditionally a Realo, you’ve been uncompromising in your leftist stances - some see this unwavering integrity as a recipe for success, while others believe it could be a detriment. In an internal meeting you’re asked frankly: “Is this the way our party should follow?”
A1: I stand by my course: 2011, 2018 and 2019 showed us how Germany is fed up with the excuses on climate change. On this issue, our politics has lost all links to reality, because it’s not radical enough. We can not decide against all the knowledge and all the facts about climate change, we need to do something!
F1: By sticking to your guns on climate, your core voters are mobilized, singing out the message far and wide. Other voters do still care about other topics though - as long as you can combine the enthusiasm around you with a broader appeal to change, your momentum could sweep you right into first place.
A2: Stateliness and radicalism aren’t opposites! To really change something, we can’t just swallow the unshackling of global capitalism. We decided on taxing the rich as a party, but we’d be crazy if we didn’t think on a grander scale: instead of arguing about the instruments, we need to ask some critical questions about our economic system!
F2: Some old Greens are warmly reminded of the rowdy, maoist 1960’s - but as they snap back to reality, even they fear how this rhetoric might land in the center of society. The Union immediately starts its fear mongering around you as a “radical ecosocialist” - and your prospects for a coalition with them or the FDP plummet.
A3: Look, I get it. We need to win societal and parliamentary majorities, so that our country becomes more just. If that means tampering our rhetoric a bit, so be it. It is our job to provide a good offer for the progressive-left center of this country, and while that includes classically leftist answers, it also goes beyond them.
F3: Your pivot back to the center is noted by the media - while some activists are wary, the base is rallied sufficiently already. Your course-correction could prevent the worst among centrists, as long as you stay your course, but try not to seem like a political opportunist.

Richtungsfrage Rechts
EQ3: Since the beginning of your leadership, the Green party was observed to have moved to the center. While some believe you’re finally ready to be regarded as a “Volkspartei”, others are fearful that you’re eroding their identity, similar to the SPD. In a tense internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: “Is this the way our party should follow?”
A1: Ideology isn’t that important to me. I want to answer questions on important issues: what about older people in rural areas, what about the education system, the origins of poverty? We need to listen to different people; environmental protection, social justice and economic prosperity don’t contradict themselves. As a modern party, let us cast a broad net.
F1: Casting a broad net is important, but there is significant concern about your leadership among Fundis. If you can overcome the internal quarrels though, your pitch might be well received by voters. Markus Söder even says a few good words about your campaign - Laschet must be seething.
A2: Look, ecological goals don’t just have to be ambitious, they have to be reachable, and affordable. We need to leave the image of a “prohibitory party” behind us - frankly, we have failed in the past with tax-raising-debates - instead we should support sensible, workable policies. Work from within the system - sticking to dogma doesn’t get us anywhere.
F2: The few Fundis that are still left take this as a direct slight towards them - Robert can contain a leadership challenge only at the last minute. To the media, this confirms your ongoing pivot to the Right: While you do hit the nerve of some voters, the Animal Protection Party also seems to gain traction these days, especially among students.
A3: I wanted to broaden our appeal by showing how we’re open to all of society, open to other arguments. That said, our party needs a strongly defined profile, I agree. In the coming campaign, we should increasingly emphasize our environmentalism and center-left attitude.
F3: Many op-eds notice an increasing discrepancy between your past rhetoric and the new election posters you’re on. You seem like a bit of a flip-flopper - although your party members continue to defend you vehemently. Hopefully the voters won’t care.

Falls Habeck antagonisiert und Likeability unter 10:
Q17: It’s now less than two months until the election, and the campaign is heating up. It’s time to hit <b>The Campaign Trail</b>! In your travels around the country, what region do you want to focus your efforts on over the next few weeks?
A1: Robert Habeck is currently on a pretty popular tour across the North Sea coast. Let’s join him to show the unity of our party and produce some great pictures of us as the ‘dynamic duo’!
F1: Your chemistry is… a bit middling now, it turns out. You provide for some nice pictures on the North Sea coast, North Frisia, Sylt and Hamburg - but it’s clear how disappointed Habeck is that he isn’t the candidate. It leaks out to you that he’s planning to give some interviews after the election. Power really does change people, it seems.

Q25: The 26th of September is almost here. This has been a wild ride, and come what may, the Greens will have had a moment that will be talked about years from now. Hopefully, it hasn’t passed yet! In the final days of the campaign, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A2: If there is one Green name that’s as important as mine these days it’s “Robert Habeck”. Despite our minor issues, Robert was always a loyal compatriot. We are the faces of our party, and with his outstanding people-skills, I want to rally with him to show what the Greens have to offer, all across Northern Germany.
F2: Robert is still broadly popular, especially in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein. His appearance brings out the crowds, leaving many to doubt your refusal to embrace him more closely earlier on. Still, the rallies are an outstanding success. Now, enjoy some time with your family in Potsdam, and let’s hope Germany’s voters are “Ready, because you are”.

EQ10: There has been plenty of talk about your performance thus far as chancellor candidate. You have had numerous gaffes and your image is not as clean as it once was with the press. It might be sexism, it might be genuine concern; but fact of the matter is, many think Robert Habeck would have been a better candidate - and openly demand him to take over and save The Greens’ campaign. There have even been some public calls from lower level Green party officials asking for the same thing.
A1: This is unbelievable. These rumors are pure sexism, and I will meet the demands head-on. I’m going to make a statement that replacing the only woman in this race will be an affront to all German girls and women deserving of representation.
F1: Your own party takes you aside and tells you that it might actually not just be sexism. They agree that you’ve been treated by unfair standards, but something has to give - and most think, it’s you.
</br>Few days later, you receive a fateful call. You hang up, dissolved. Robert calls you, shortly after. You’re to talk it over, about the announcement. He’s sorry.
A2: I won’t even address these concerns. They are of no serious importance. I’ll just let my party dispel these rumors and keep campaigning like normal.
F2: Oh yes, they are. Think of Hillary Clinton - “likeability” seems to be a real thing for voters. Merkel herself willingly softened her image around 2015. Your party is unusually hesitant to defend you these days. Behind closed doors, the rumor is you aren’t taking this thing seriously.
</br> Few days later, you receive a fateful call. You hang up, dissolved. Robert calls you, shortly after. You’re to talk it over, about the announcement. He’s sorry.
A3: I have to take this seriously. I will change some staff around and amend my rhetoric, I will be out there with full passion, making myself more visible. Maybe we can give a few likable interviews in my home, showing off my hard work as a mother.
F3: Your renewed vigor and change in tactics could temporarily stop the bleeding, but your numbers are still abhorrent compared to the beginning of this campaign. The party is happy that you’ve recognized the problem and are doing something about it, but it will take a lot more than this to make an epic comeback.
A4: They’re not ready. I have to admit it - I really want to lead this country into a new age, but without the right numbers, it won’t be possible. These annoying inconveniences won’t tamper with our momentum anymore. Robert, it seems this is your time after all: take it away.
F4: Robert understands. He talks it over with the party bosses, who are a bit relieved. Within a week, they prepared statements for the both of you. It is a hard moment, stepping in front of the camera, and announcing your unprecedented retreat from the candidacy.

F1: People find this tone a bit uncomfortable. Your own party takes you aside and tells you that while these rants are warranted, electorally, they’re counterproductive. Nevermind how unfairly you’ve been treated, you’ll quickly have to turn this ship around if you want to appeal to the voters you need to change Germany for the better.
A2: I won’t even address these concerns. They are of no serious importance. I’ll just let my party dispel these rumors and keep campaigning like normal.

A1: The future doesn’t just happen - it’s created. By courageous people who grow beyond themselves, every day.

F2: Germans certainly haven’t been too keen on egregious mudslinging in the past. Your principled stance gains some early praise - but if you want to keep this up, you will have to uphold your popularity numbers. Hopefully, everything around your person is in good order.
