Greens-Habeck

EQ1: The year is 2018. Millions of German teenagers protest in the streets. Fridays For Future demands for „Climate Justice“. In between all the frustration with the political status quo, your party experiences a vindication of its environmental policies and a gigantic polling surge. You've just been voted in as party leader – how do The Greens plan to capitalize on this 'wind of change'?
A1: We are the opposite of the AfD. In times where the parliament pivots rightwards, where sexism and racism are back on the agenda, it's The Greens job to hold up high the left-liberal, emancipatory flag. If we can position ourselves as the primary voice for progressives, the media will focus on our values. And this is only the beginning.
F1: In the post 2015-discourse, while every other party seems divided over where society is headed, you provide for a clear contrast and a loud voice for progressives all over the country. Of course, this puts you in a direct confrontation with those who feel alienated by the political leftwards turn, framing the societal discourse around The Greens and the AfD over the next few months. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A2: We need to put climate change into the center of every politic. We support „Fridays For Future“ – they want an awakening, because they know, this is about the future of all of us. Let's stand with them in the streets, protesting for a cleaner and safer tomorrow. And this is only the beginning.
F2: The youth seems as politically active as they haven't been in years. Famous Youtuber Rezo even produces a viral video in 2019, chastising the government's climate policies. You are the ‘party of the environment’ and this is your core constituency - your activation of young voters displays strength and garners momentum, even among some parents. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A3: We aren't just firmly situated in the leftist camp - we need to become the leading party of the center-left. The SPD is weak, if we can position ourselves as the more credible option for disappointed Social Democrats, especially on social policy, we will supersede them as the party of the left spectrum. And this is only the beginning.
F3: The „Good Old“ SPD certainly seems to be on its last legs these days. It's been a downward spiral ever since Schröder lost to Merkel – and in between neoliberalism and three GroKo's, they've seemingly lost so much of their profile that The Greens seem like a good option to many of their former voters nowadays. <br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…
A4: We need a fresh breath of air after these 14 years of Merkel and GroKo's. The progressive, modern center is getting more and more carved out – all the more important it becomes to do optimistic politics. It's now our job to make a political and societal offer, as an alternative to the status quo. And this is only the beginning.
F4: You and Annalena Baerbock are a young, dynamic duo, popular in your appearances, drawing a nice contrast to the old, unpopular politicians of the establishment. While you're avoiding more specific lines, people start to perceive The Greens as an actual opportunity for change.<br>Unfortunately though, Covid soon hits the country, changing the narrative once again…

Q2: It’s finally 2021. It’s getting real - election season is here.<br>Although your momentum from 2018 has been stopped by Covid, the CDU still seems vulnerable with its own crisis in leadership post-Merkel. Meanwhile, The Greens are in second place, and you’re gonna have to discuss who’s going to be the first Green chancellor candidate. <br>You and your co-leader Annalena Baerbock plan to announce something next month: until then, what do you want to do in the meantime?
A1: Two years ago, I deleted my social media accounts. However, in this day and age, you need social media for a successful election campaign. I will reactivate them and start posting!
F1: It’s true that social media is almost expected today, so this probably helps you with your political communication - as long as you avoid posting controversial statements like the ones that made you deactivate your accounts in the first place!
A2: If I want to become chancellor, I have to have a clean presentation, and can’t afford any sloppiness. I’ll make sure things like my finances are in order and my team will check if there are any problems with my website, or other stuff on the internet.
F2: Despite thoroughly searching for potential problems, you just don’t find anything for you. Annalena meanwhile notices some inconsistencies on her side and fixes them. It’s always better to be safe than sorry - but maybe this time could also have been spent more economically.
A3:  I want to get out there, go to talk shows, give interviews, and generally make sure the German people know me. This should improve both my name recognition and my favorability ratings.
F3: You were called “talk show king” in 2018, and with your repeated visits to talk shows like “<i>Maybrit Illner</i>” and “<i>Presseclub</i>”, the media chatters wildly about your ambitions. Your attitude is laid back, relatable and folksy - although for many people, you already seem ubiquitous.
A4: Friday for Future is capable of mobilizing a massive amount of people. We need to restart the “climate summer” and focus media attention on the environmentalist movement. I will visit some demonstrations and meet with the FFF-leadership to get them on our side.
F4: Luisa Neubauer, main coordinator of FFF Germany, is indeed a Green party member, but she’s not a diehard loyalist: even your party has been criticized by Fridays for Future for not being ambitious enough. Still: your efforts effectively mobilize the youth vote and pad out your floor in polling.

Q1: Unfortunately for you, the surge doesn’t last. The Corona Pandemic hits in 2020, and quickly dominates the news, politics and daily life. Merkel regains popularity in leading the crisis response, although soon after, cracks start to show. With the Greens not governing on the federal level, you can do little in terms of actual policy - how do you frame your stance on the government's Covid policies?
A1: Overall, we support the government’s policies. I will criticize their chaotic response, but we can not endanger societal cohesion: in contrast to the AfD, we’ll make it clear that we broadly stand behind all necessary measures.
F1: Certainly admirable. The German people are happy, and you don’t attract negative headlines while building bridges with the government parties. You aren’t really blunting the CDU’s momentum, but maybe that can wait until election season.
A2: Since the beginning of the pandemic, there hasn’t been enough of a focus on children and families. We need to build the circumstances to return to regular schooling, we need tests in daycares and schools, as well as fight the lack of teachers. There has to be an educational package for all kids in this country.
F2: If you want to stand out in attacking the government, this is a good way to go about it. As a parent of young children yourself, these remarks come off as authentic: many feel that the needs of their kids have not been adequately met. Also, many young students might be first-time-voters for you, come election season.
A3: While the lockdowns were absolutely necessary at the beginning of the pandemic, we should be mindful - there has to be a balance between freedom and safety. The curfews, for example, are a strong restriction of a basic right that might not be proportional - we always have to see if we can use milder methods.
F3: Although many restrictions are unpopular, most experts agree that they are necessary right now. Your party doesn’t seem to agree on a clear stance; some say, you’re doing opposition for opposition's sake. That said, you continue to foster an unlikely friendship with the FDP - a relationship that might become useful after the next election…
A4: We support measures to combat Covid and to rebuild our economy. Most importantly though, this was the first time that healthcare was more important than profit interests and growth. The lesson here is that we need to design our economy around common interests, including environmental protection. The time of small compromises is over.
F4: An attempt at Agenda-Setting? Climate may be your party’s main appeal, but Covid is still ubiquitous in people’s lives. Your vaguely anticapitalist pitch is well worded, but try not to veer too much from the national discussion.


Q3: Most already guessed it, but the party now officially decided on you, as their top candidate. Despite the party’s focus on Gender parity, your eventual nomination seemed inevitable, and with your favorability and name recognition, the party is as fired up as ever. <br> Alright Robert, you’re it! Now is the time to break the news and to give your announcement speech as the first ever Green chancellor candidate!
A1: I want to establish a new style of governance in Germany. The Greens are offering up a new idea of politics. We need to be radical and stately: to be consistent and progressive, but also to listen to every argument. I offer you change, through this new kind of politics, and will use my government experience to lead Germany into a new age.
F1: In the climax of your entire career, you seem to sum up your entire political identity: “pragmatic idealism”. Many have been speculating if The Greens are the next ‘Volkspartei’ - this speech seems to seal the deal. With both CDU and SPD struggling in the polls, your vague pitch could appeal to many voters. “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A2: We need a livable future for our country. We need the whole arsenal of politics, not just a higher price for Co², to fulfill this gigantic transformatory task of stopping climate change. We have to become completely climate neutral over the next 20 years. If we protect the climate, we're protecting ourselves: and I am running to do just that.
F2: In your first pitch, you’re bringing the discussion right back to The Greens core topic: climate change. Is it enough to win? With the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls, an energized campaign might very well be worth a try. “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A3: Through elections, a country decides its future. Eight years of Grand coalition and sixteen years of CDU chancellorship haven’t given us answers for our future - and a lack of answers is evident of a lack of responsibility. This can not continue: a Green chancellor candidacy offers Germany a new future, away from the politics of standstill.
F3: It is frustration with the Status Quo that has brought you here in the first place; the people cry for change. With the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls right now, you might be able to deliver in the fall. Many voters now have high hopes for you to introduce a new style to the chancellorship of “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A4: The Greens are the new center. We need changes instead of promises, to continue our fight for an open and tolerant society, but this society has to serve the broad masses. It is cohesion and solidarity that’s at the center of our “politics of partnership”. The change we need is only possible with majorities of the German people, through workable compromises.
F4: Many gambled on you to finally make the Greens ready for governance. With a centrist pitch, you gamble that the Fundis-wing of the Party is truly dead, evoking Winfried Kretschmann’s attitude. As both the CDU and SPD are struggling, there might be an opening for you with their voters - as long as your base doesn’t revolt, you might win over “Germany. Everything is possible”.

Q4: After a messy leadership contest, the CDU has - somewhat unexpectedly - chosen Markus Söder as their chancellor candidate. Although the mask scandal has seemingly provided you with an opening, their polling slip has stopped after Söder’s nomination went over quite well. Meanwhile, the SPD has chosen Olaf Scholz last year already to lead them into this pivotal race.<br> With all three main parties having chosen their candidates, it's time to decide on a general strategy for this pivotal race.
A1: It’s clear that the SPD is not going to win this election, and we need it to stay that way. I want to present myself as the main candidate of the left-of-center and try to coalesce left-wing voters around the Greens. If we can make this a one-on-one against Söder, I’m sure our appeal to change will win over the status quo.
F1: Your traditional base has seemingly expanded, ever since the SPD collapsed into the sub-twenties. Some pundits wonder though, if hitting downwards is the right way to capitalize on the Greens' newfound polling highs. Defending your second place seems a bit cautious, and leftist infighting might be beneficial to critics from your right.
A2: Traditionally, the Greens have been left of center. However, these are exceptional circumstances. We need to draw votes from our main competitor, the Union - Markus Söder is a strong candidate, and he needs to be taken down a notch if we want to compete with him over centrists. We might have to amend our rhetoric on some topics to do this.
F2: Söder’s polling numbers are what gave him the candidacy, and focussing on this issue might be the way to go. There are many swing voters sympathetic to both of you - if you can keep the left of your party from rebelling, pivoting towards the center a tad could be advantageous.
A3: Our base is largely young, urban, and well-off - with the right strategy, we can generate an enthusiasm unseen in past Federal Elections. They are frustrated, and we have actual credentials for them. We will put more resources into mobilization efforts to get the youth to turn out this election. Maybe we can get a Rezo-endorsement?
F3: Your turnout-focused strategy might get more first-time voters to the polls, but this might not be enough to expand into first place. The electorate skews older in almost every election, and your core base only netted you around 8.9% last time - the sheer number of old people in Germany might just be too large. Meanwhile, Rezo declines to actually endorse anyone publicly, although he does publish another video attacking the Union’s Covid-policies.
A4: Our polling numbers in West Germany are great, but we are struggling to even get to 10% in many East German states. East Germany has been neglected by the status quo for a long time, and we might be able to present our ideas of change to an untapped voter potential there.
F4: Until now, the Green Party message really didn't seem to resonate with East Germany - instead, the party is mostly confined to the cities, being seen as “elitist”. The region is known for low turnout in general though - maybe you can get some of those people to go out and vote Green this time?

Q5: With a Green chancellor now looking like a realistic option, many skeptics of the past are giving the party a second look. One issue that might make them suspect is foreign policy - The Greens historically stem from the pacifist movement, although there seemingly has been a change ever since Joschka Fischer was Vice Chancellor. Now, an interviewer asks you for your focus on Germany’s role in the world.
A1: While we stand by NATO and a value-based realism on foreign policy, I am skeptical towards the goal to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. We can’t just raise the defense budget, we need to improve our capabilities and prevent crises before they happen.
F1: Foreign policy is not a big deal in this election, but the CDU of course continues to needle you. There is concern about the state of the Bundeswehr, although your answer has appeal to those weary of warmongering and the broader center-left, without being too aggravating. The fiscal wiggle room later on might also be worth it.
A2: We need to drive a tougher line against Russian aggression in the east. We are not just against Nord-Stream 2, I also favor sending defensive weapons to Ukraine. If you really take a look at that conflict, we can’t deny them help for their self defense.
F2: The Greens really have changed - this positions you as even more hawkish than your opponents. The Ukraine conflict has been frozen since 2014, is a harsh line really worth it here? Your steadfast position has drawn criticism even from inside your party - let's hope it will be vindicated some day…
A3: The Green party has always been the party of pacifism. We need to overthink our levels of military spending and are against weapon exports to crisis regions and dictatorships. We need a more restrictive control of arms exports in the EU.
F3: 30 years ago, this would have been a mainstream position within your party - now, it’s on the fringe, and a worldview too simplistic for the median voter. The SPD smells weakness and needles you on your stance towards NATO - are The Greens not ready for leadership after all, or do you believe in a silent majority?
A4: We don’t want to rock the boat here. Let’s let Annalena make some statements, she’s the foreign policy expert. I just want to reaffirm our commitment to NATO while emphasizing that wars can only be solved diplomatically.
F4: People really don't know what to make of your vagueness, but maybe keeping the conversation on more salient issues is worth it. Annalena is more than happy to present her ideas for a “feminist foreign policy”, keeping your relationship harmonic.

EQ2: You’re invited to a talk show about immigration and refugees. Although tempers have cooled a bit since 2015, the discussion around Merkel's decision to welcome the refugees 6 years ago is still relevant - particularly for the AfD, who got driven into parliament on this issue in 2017. Germany is still a popular destination for many foreigners seeking a better life, yet the nation does not seem prepared for this. What stance do you take in this debate?
A1: I supported Merkel's decision at the time, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency Frontex.
F1: European cooperation is your strong suit, and your answer is positively noted by some formerly skeptical pundits - but this still leaves a weird conservative aftertaste in the mouth of your supporters. Normally, the Greens are quite multiculturalist; now, the SPD might actually outflank you on this issue, if you can believe it.
A2: There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.
F2: While many expected you to focus on humanitarianism, your embrace of qualified immigration is well received by pragmatists. A few activists want you to go further - they are uncomfortable with you ranking immigrants on their economic potential, and smell an unwanted pivot on refugees.
A3: Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We say: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.
F3: A strong principled stance that follows progressive doctrine. You’re probably the party best-positioned to represent the cultural left on this issue. You can use that to your advantage, as long as you don’t let right wing trolls get under your skin.
A4: On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - 2015 can’t repeat itself.
F4: Wh-what? Did you have an eye-opening talk with Boris Palmer? Journalists speculate that this was an attempt at a joke. Your party is shocked beyond belief and forces you to apologize the next day - but the damage is already done. The AfD feels humorously satisfied at you vindicating them, as your support plummets in favor of Scholz and other progressives.

Q6: May 2021: This might be your lucky break. Another scandal for the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin is now working on passing a stricter law - as the Green candidate, you’re asked for a comment.
A1: There's a real chance here to make some big strides together. However, the current proposal does not do that - it doesn't just suffice to have stricter goals, we need a big package with concrete measures, concerning an exit from coal, renewable energies and the striking of environmentally harmful subsidies.
F1: This is a valid critique that is shared by many experts - the Climate Protection Act certainly has ambitious goals, but lacks a concrete path to get there. Your party is the leading voice on environmentalism to the public, and a focus on action is certain to strengthen that view.
A2: This decision isn't just about the numbers. It's about a categorical shift in our understanding of politics - the courts' explanation was built not on environmentalism, but on Freedom. If you protect the climate, you protect freedoms. It's not just about free markets versus rules - It is rules and guidelines which make us free in the first place! On these grounds, we need to readjust our climate policy together.
F2: The Greens are usually known as a <i>”Verbotspartei”</i> a “prohibitory party”. This decision has given you an opportunity to change that image - and your impassioned plea is received well by the broader electorate. Although some, even in your own party, wish for more concrete measures instead of a philosophy lesson.
A3: This is no room for party-political games, we have an obligation to act here and today. The CDU has failed us for 16 years, and the SPD is complicit! Climate protection through Sunday speeches doesn’t suffice. They have failed to promote renewable energies and endangered countless jobs!
F3: The Greens clearly feel vindicated after this decision. Just don’t squander your newfound goodwill here - the Germans want a concrete plan. This toxic language doesn’t really fit your personality and is harshly criticized by Söder, who seeks to capitalize by overhauling his own measures in Bavaria.
A4: The government has readjusted the numbers in its law. They might not be enough for Paris, but they are already ambitious. What we need now are the means to meet these goals; to use all means possible to fulfill this gigantic task. Of course we need smart investments through the state, but we also need the free markets and entrepreneurship to fulfill this societal quest.
F4: You’re praised for your non-partisan demeanor, and observers definitely notice a pitch of moderacy. Is this what your party wants, though? Baerbock takes a much harsher tone in the parliamentary debate and privately tells you that hitting harder here could be your lucky break.

Q7: Green party statutes mandate that lists always have to follow gender parity, having a woman on the first spot. While this doesn’t directly carry over to nominations, many in your own party were disappointed to see a man become the first Green chancellor candidate, instead of a woman. How do you want to address these concerns?
A1: This was a decision we made together, Annalena and I agreed that I would be the more electable candidate. Besides, it’s kinda sexist on its own to say that she should have gotten the nomination just because she’s a woman.
F1: You’re not helping yourself with these kinds of comments. Annalena is popular in the party, and the chatter about the Gender question doesn’t stop. This might undercut the enthusiasm from some female voters, seeing as how after 16 years of Angela Merkel, she will almost certainly be succeeded by a man.
A2: I recognize that we have a problem with not enough women being in the highest positions of power. That’s why I promise that as chancellor, half of my cabinet will consist of women, and we will look at extensive measures to advance the equality of all genders in Germany.
F2: You sidestep addressing the allegations directly, instead answering with a strong promise. Your base is soothed and you do regain credibility with feminists, though some wonder if a cabinet following Gender parity will be achievable in a coalition with the more center-right parties.
A3: Annalena and I are co-party leaders and she will play a crucial part in this campaign. I want to campaign more frequently on her side, with her being our main voice on foreign policy and similar matters.
F3: Annalena is happy to cooperate, and your base is happy at seeing the ‘dynamic duo’ in action, quelling any dissent from her fans. However, there are doubters who wonder how appropriate it is that a chancellor candidate is already delegating matters of policy, on such a crucial topic nonetheless.
A4: It’s important that we stay united as a party if we want to win this election, and we can’t keep lingering on questions of personalities, as the Union so often does. Annalena Baerbock and I agreed that I should be the candidate, but she will of course have a bright political future in this country, for example with a prominent spot in my cabinet.
F4: This comes across as somewhat defensive, but it does the trick. Your party agrees that winning this election is more important than petty squabbling - meanwhile Annalena would be stoked to take over the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of the Environment, although she is a bit sulky.

Q8: In the past, you’ve been under fire for some rather bizarre statements you made on Twitter, like calling Bavaria a one-party state or talking about bringing democracy to Thuringia. In response, you deleted your social media presence - which was also criticized. The media is worried about your temperament - and with your chancellor candidacy, the matter comes up once again.
A1: It was a wise decision to delete my Twitter account, I stand by that. The platform is not good for political discourse - and the young and cool people are somewhere else anyway. Besides, there are Green Party accounts for people to follow if they want to stay up to date.
F1: Perhaps you’re right in your analysis, after all, there are more important demographics to win over than terminally online keyboard warriors. Still, social media is a crucial part of every campaign nowadays - and falling back on the party’s official accounts might not fully cut it.
A2: What I really meant to say was, that it’s unhealthy for Bavaria to be governed by the CSU alone and how Thuringia is under attack from antidemocratic forces on the right. It’s disgusting how certain political actors are now using my personal decisions to further their political aims.
F2: Look, you might have a point, but your pivot to attacks seems a bit petty and desperate. It immediately peaks the interest of Markus Söder, who hits on your comments about his CSU in his next speech, to ruckus applause by his base.
A3: Twitter is encouraging a polemic style of discussion. The aggressiveness, loudness and pointedness of that platform, combined with its fast pace makes it difficult to sit down and think. Furthermore, they are blatantly stealing data - we need further regulation of social media firms.
F3: Although many people will still use social media, segueing into your own policy proposals is a smart move. The debate refocuses around substantial issues, instead of your past gaffes.


Q9: Climate action is the Green’s main topic. While many voters want stricter environmental policies, Germany is also the “country of cars”. Due to this, there’s a certain disconnect between the Greens' promise to lower CO²-emissions and the Germans' love for automobiles: in an interview, you’re asked what your policies might mean for the price of gasoline.
A1: I can only wonder about the obliviousness and self righteousness of the other parties. A higher price on CO² is effective in combating climate change, as we all agree - we stand for a price hike of 16 cents per liter over the next five years. People with poorer income will be relieved through measures to tax the wealthy more than we do now.
F1: Your comments are pointed, but sharp. That said, people, especially in rural regions, are distressed about your plans. Some of them might have considered voting for you, but it’s these positions that scare them off from The Greens. Söder immediately jumps to catch them back - it might be best to move on to something more advantageous.
A2: Mainly, we want to strengthen public transit and alternative sources of fuel. Of course, higher prices for consumers and at the gas station would impact people differently, according to income. My focus is on politically compensating this inequality, and giving back any earnings from the CO²-price to the citizens - households with smaller incomes would profit the most from this.
F2: Your plans to redistribute the burden of climate change through CO² prices are popular with economically left-wing voters, but your refusal to talk about numbers makes some people uneasy, on both sides of the debate. Legal experts also question the practicability of your proposal.
A3: At the end of the day, traffic must be completely free of emissions. “Freedom through the car” is an illusion that we’re still living today - instead, we need to look towards collective methods of transport. Gas prices will have to rise around 28 cents, and in individual cities, a City-road-toll could be useful. Buses and trains are where our future lies.
F3: Everyone but the most ardent environmentalists is deeply alarmed by this statement - they fear they wouldn’t be able to afford a car anymore. Rural voters are especially skeptical towards this stance - after all, buses aren’t popular, and the train network is… well… administered by the Deutsche Bahn.
A4: No environmental protection will hurt us. After the price for CO2 went into effect at the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen by 6 cents per liter already - we should work within that constraint. The key here is more infrastructure for electrical cars, and the import of renewable energy to fuel them.
F4: The interviewer is positively surprised by your moderacy, as electrical car infrastructure  is even supported by the CDU/CSU. However, the next day, Fridays For Future calls for its supporters to vote for special “Climate Lists”, instead of you - this will hurt your momentum with young voters. Hopefully you can make up for it.

Q10: As the election comes closer, your favorability numbers seem to take a hit. Over the course of its history, the Green Party has acquired the reputation of being an elitist party for the highly educated, urban and wealthy. You yourself have studied germanistics, philosophy and philology, giving your opponent an opening to call you an ivory-tower intellectual. How do you want to combat this developing narrative?
A1: This is more of a problem with the whole party than with me personally. To counter this image, I want to work with concrete proposals, to put a bigger focus on our programs to help poor and disadvantaged people in this country.
F1: Söder is pretty good at playing the people game, and still has pretty stable popularity numbers. However, you are making inroads with your approach - it is remarked upon positively, how The Greens really do seem to broaden their appeal. Hopefully people will vote on party, not person, in 2021.
A2: When I was minister in Schleswig-Holstein, I talked with everyone, even with people who would never vote Green. We should listen more, what stories are there in our society, what kind of experiences move the people? That’s where we have to connect.
F2: Your authentic approach wins you the hearts of many people you talk to. Of course, you can only connect with a small number of voters personally - but this approachable and sympathetic style does become a trademark of your political brand, one that catapults you back to the top of the pack in likeability, despite earlier issues.
A3: This is a problem all parties in the Bundestag struggle with - there are many more people with a college degree than without in our parliament. We all have to work together to change this.
F3: You’re not wrong, but the Greens are a big offender here - 85% in your party group are from a higher education, 12% didn’t even finish their degree. While you’re personally distanced from this problem, the traditional brand of your party is still a holdup for many possible voters.
A4: I disagree, I believe my education might be of use. We can further consolidate high education voters and provide my campaign with a unique visionary angle. I want to show off my credentials and my degree at several speeches in the coming months.
F4: Robert, your thesis was literally called <i>“The Nature of Literature: About the Genre-Theoretical Reasoning of Literary Aestheticism”</i>. Try to make friends with a factory worker over that one. </br>The elitism thing seems to catch fire - Söder is careful with his attacks, but alludes to your attitude several times. He does seem to win the personality battle for now.

Q11:  Since 2005, long-time unemployed people in Germany get money from the state at the subsistence level, the so-called Hartz IV. However, the amount of this aid is quite small, and recipients receive sanctions if they are not looking for a job. Many people are not happy with this system that the Greens helped introduce - what is your stance nowadays?
A1: We need to replace the Hartz IV-system with a “citizen’s money”, in which recipients would receive at least 50€ more. There should be no more sanctions if someone isn’t actively looking for a job, and there will be other reliefs, in the form of price caps on gas and electrical energy.
F1: Your answer echoes the most immediate concerns that left-wingers have with Hartz IV, though still being palpable for moderates. Many are dissatisfied with the current system, and winning brownie-points among your base is a good way of keeping everyone content. Hopefully your policies will prove effective.
A2: The current level of Hartz IV is a disgrace. The system needs to be reworked from the ground-up, and needs to be a massive raise, by around 200€, accounting for inflation. The sanctions are also unnecessary and inhumane, they should end. We also need further aid, like basic child security funding.
F2: With your staunchly leftwing a position, you siphon over some Left voters and poorer people. Your strong stance isn’t exactly out of character, but it frightens some fiscal moderate Realos, while conservatives attack you for wanting unchecked government handouts.
A3: We need another social system. The times have moved on from Hartz IV. There are so many transformation processes, where many individual problems will come up, that we can't leave everyone to their own. We need basic protections for people, not just to force them to work without dignity. That's why I propose a universal basic income of 1200€ per month.
F3: There have been numerous discussions about this idea in your party. The state-provided minimum income appeals to ardent left-wingers, while the promises of bureaucracy reform might even be appealing to some eccentric fiscal conservatives. On the whole though, experts doubt your math here - this idea is still on the fringe and not all that popular.
A4: The system needs some minor adjustments - we can look into gradually raising the amount of money and lessen sanctions. However, we have to be careful that it doesn’t become excessive - people shouldn’t be invited to infinitely put up the heating, because we’re paying for it. They should have incentives to be careful about their energy consumption.
F4: Your comment incurs a small social media shitstorm, and SPD and Die Linke openly criticize you as indifferent to poor people. It was your party who participated in the introduction of Hartz IV under Gerhard Schröder - while you could win over some moderates, just stay clear from this association.

Richtungsfrage Mitte
EQ3: With you as chancellor candidate, the Green campaign finally got going. One reason for your success might be your perceived pragmatism: the Realo-wing of the party has finally taken over and made the Greens electable for the average German. Others say, the increased salience of climate change has given the Green’s policies a new relevance in the political landscape. In an internal meeting you’re asked frankly: “How do we win this thing?”
A1: There’s a wind of change blowing through Germany: climate change is finally taken seriously by the media. We are perceived as most competent on this issue - as long as we press the attack and define a solid profile on climate action, we can keep up our momentum all the way to election day.
F1: Climate change is what catapulted you into your pole position in the first place - it’s not a bad thing to frame this election around your strongest issue. You are expected to branch out a bit though, The Greens have often been criticized as a “one-issue-party”- if you can show off some real leadership, maybe that can change.
A2: I think the people are tired of politics-as-usual, especially after 16 years of Merkel. I will run on an optimistic take - “Germany can do so much more”. Let’s stand by our stances and campaign on the issues without getting intimidated - ignore the mudslinging, and trust in our sympathy levels.
F2: Germans certainly haven’t been too keen on egregious mudslinging in the past. Your principled stance gains some early praise - but if you want to keep this up, you can’t let the campaign get derailed by character-issues, or else you’ll seem tone-deaf. Hopefully, everything around your person is in good order.
A3: Of course, people want change - but in order for them to follow through, we need to make our rhetoric and policies palatable to the average voter. Our goal is first place after all - Kretschmann showed us how it works in Baden-Württemberg. Let’s present ourselves as a stately new party, ready to govern.
F3: You’re shooting for The Greens to become a sustainable ‘Volkspartei’, it seems. Your rightwards pivot gains mixed reactions, but you did open the door to older generations and even curious Union-voters. This might pay off in the long run, if you can keep up the momentum as Laschet’s alternative.

Q12: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbors, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. The lockdowns in the wake of the Covid-pandemic have only made this more salient. What part of the Green program here do you want to emphasize?
A1: Germany is abhorrently underdigitalized. Digitalization must be organized from the top, with a right to a fast internet connection and significant investments that the current government has slept on. However, I believe a dedicated ministry would hamper these efforts, through bureaucratic red tape.
F1: It’s good to press the attack here - you were part of the opposition in the last decade and can credibly offer change. Particularly rural people are tired of the sluggish bureaucracy around the advancement of fiber-optic infrastructure. Your concerns with a centralized ministry puts you at odds with Söder, but that debate is too wonky for people to care.
A2: We need a great European cloud-infrastructure based on Open Source technology, to provide for a great amount of data for the development of AI. We need to invest into AI, to improve Germany as a location for High Tech businesses. We also need regulations around AI usage in art and science.
F2: Many people are wondering why you’re focussing on AI - it doesn’t really register as a big topic in 2021. While experts praise your ambition, most simply do not care about your lofty rhetoric. That said, maybe being prepared here could pay off in the future.
A3: There’s too little investment for the digital furnishing of Germany’s public services.  During the Covid-pandemic, the bureaucracy hasn’t even been able to give out digital vaccination appointments! We need less paper files and innovative solutions, like a digital personal identity with good data protection.
F3: These are some innovative solutions - improving Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is quite popular. However, most parties are calling for some action on this front - your framing does not make you stand out. The FDP meanwhile drives their strategy on this issue in particular.
A4: We need to focus on data protection. Big Tech has to be regulated in its data usage, and our data has to be kept safe from American companies. We will defend the right for privacy, particularly in light of the information unveiled by Edward Snowden.
F4: Although your heart might be in the right place, the Snowden affair was 12 years ago, and is not a particularly important topic in this election. Germans are a bit wary of American companies, but since data protection seems to be a boring topic, most don’t listen to your promises.

Q13: The German Autobahn is currently known for its lack of a speed limit. One often proposed measure to reduce carbon emissions is to change that, as your party has demanded time and time again. Of course, this is quite a contentious topic among carlovers, and yet again, you’re asked about this in an interview.
A1: A tempo limit of 130 km/h will be one of the first measures of my administration.
Even the ADAC is for one. Who is even arguing against it at this point? We have to hit our emission targets somehow and reducing traffic emissions is one part of that.
F1: You’ve stuck to your principles here and strengthened your profile on climate change. A clear and concrete stance is a good thing, although this is divisive - the FDP in particular attacks you sharply. Public opinion seemingly favors you, hopefully this gets reflected at the ballot box.
A2: We need a “safety limit”: A lot of accidents and deaths could be avoided if people wouldn’t be speeding excessively. There is no right of endangering others for the sake of fun. There is no right for speeding in Germany.
F2: The data on this isn’t really conclusive, but your point seems solid to those more critical of the climate argument. While climate change is your defining topic, framing your popular policies like this can help build appeal beyond your base.
A3: We shouldn’t overestimate the effects of a tempo limit on climate change. With this being a divisive topic, we aren’t planning on focusing on this in the next legislative session. However, we will look into introducing new tempo limits on selected highways, as they already exist on certain streets.
F3: This echoes the sentiment of some Realos like Winfried Kretschmann - however your base seems quite deflated by this, and with the SPD and Left party still advocating for a general tempo limit, you seem spineless in the face of conservative critics.
A4: In light of the Covid pandemic, the allegation that a tempo limit would be an unseemly restriction of our freedoms sound ridiculous, after churches, schools etc. have been closed. We need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h on highways, 80 km/h outside of cities and 30 km/h within city limits - this might save up around 1.9 billion tons of CO² per year.
F4: While public opinion seems to be shifting in favor of a 130 km/h tempo limit, the 30 km/h within city limits is still unpopular, especially in the east. While this probably would be helpful for hitting Germany’s emission targets, a hard line like this reinforces the Greens as a predominantly urban party.

EQ4: One salient issue is the topic of pensions, particularly in light of Germany's changing demographics. Currently, pensions are distributed from a fund financed by the current working populace. However, because the number of retirees seems to grow faster than the workforce, the system is thought to be unsustainable. How do you want to address this problem?
A1: The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.
F1: This is a surprisingly conservative answer that disappoints many in your camp. You have criticized the government on its unambitious plans several times, so why not go further here? Younger voters are alienated by your statements, and environmentalists are worried about too permissive building policies.
A2: A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.
F2: You are firmly placed on the left side of the culture wars, but progressive voters interested in your campaign agree with such measures. Of course, the right side of the aisle immediately shoots back with the usual critiques of multiculturalism. You've also avoided talking about government intervention, which might make talks with the FDP easier.
A3: It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.
F3: An expected answer that broadly pleases the left-of-center. While there are always those who stress about fiscal responsibility, this is a strong answer that shows engagement with this topic and provides some popular policies. Older voters usually aren't that Green-inclined, but maybe you can persuade some curious grandparents.
A4: We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.
F4: Pundits detect a pivot to the center, for better or worse. You don't incur a lot of direct criticism, and actually get the attention of some liberals – but your base is confused about how exactly you want to safeguard the social safety net. Your youth wing actually dares to openly question why you’re not going further.

Q14: July 2021: There seems to be some problems concerning Annalena. In the past weeks, she was caught failing to report multiple extraparliamentary earnings to the Bundestag, as well as several inconsistencies in her CV. Now, her newest book allegedly contains plagiarized passages. She’s come under heavy fire - how do we deal with this?
A1: I know it’s kinda harsh, but I’m gonna talk to Annalena about this - she can’t drag this campaign down with these issues. For the rest of the campaign, I hope she’ll take a step back into the background.
F1: She sees herself as the victim of unfair attacks, and is deflated that you’d go along with this. While she retreats from the frontlines after you put your foot down, for the next few weeks, the mood at most party meetings is very subdued.
A2: Annalena Baerbock has already admitted that these were mistakes, and of course they were regrettable. However, now that everything is in order, we shouldn’t be distracted from more important topics. We need to talk about the policies!
F2: Since she is not the chancellor candidate, her problems fail to dominate the front pages for too long. Although your party’s momentum is still stunted a bit, the campaign mostly moves on.
A3: These allegations are unfair and part of a right-wing smear campaign against the Green Party in general. I will fight back and defend Annalena whenever I’m asked about this.
F3: Annalena is grateful that you’re sticking up for her, and this helps with party unity. However, this also keeps her scandals in the news cycle for longer, which isn’t helping the party’s image.
A4: The CDU/CSU was involved in a massive scandal with many of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks. Scholz of the SPD oversaw the disastrous Wirecard collapse and was involved in corrupt cum-ex banking deals. Compared to that, Baerbock’s missteps are insignificant.
F4: It’s true that Annalena’s scandals are much less serious than the ones you mentioned, but this aggressive approach leads to several accusations being thrown around, dragging down everyone’s favorability numbers. Populists on both sides of the aisle salivate at the mudslinging.

EQ5: One of the more salient issues in the current political landscape across the western world is the question of rents, particularly for younger voters. Most economic and educational opportunities increasingly lie in the big cities of the country - where rent is constantly increasing, to the point where it becomes a serious political question. What is your answer to the housing question?
A1: We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.
F1: It seems you really want to commit to making the Greens a ‘Volkspartei’ - such a promise resonates with rural areas, but your base wants to see more action to directly improve the situation by intervening in the market. There are also significant environmental concerns about using more land to build small family homes - not a good look for your profile.
A2: We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards, available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as we do in NRW. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.
F2: This is a classic Realo-like plan to deal with the crisis - although environmentalists are worried that building more might be hurtful to Germany’s ecosystem. To the left’s dismay, you avoid the topic of rent controls, but given similar plans in Berlin were ruled unconstitutional, no one can blame you. ‘Do no harm.’
A3: The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a rent moratorium.
F3: Your party base loves this - the Greens are predominantly urban after all. This should reinforce youth turnout, which can only be good for you. Keep in mind though that a similar plan by your state party in Berlin has been ruled unconstitutional recently, so tread lightly if you actually want to deliver.
A4: Apartments are people's homes, not investments. We can’t afford half measures: we need a federal rent freeze in regions where the capitalist market failed, lower existing costs, if necessary with expropriations. We need new social housing units and the renovation of old buildings - we can even look at legalizing squatting, if it serves the reappropriation of misused spaces.
F4: While some Fundis and the Green Youth appreciate your anti-capitalist pivot, everyone else does not. Many unideological voters looked to the Greens as an interesting new option, transformed from their socialist student-movement past - now they feel like you’ve proven them wrong.

Q15: July 2021: Catastrophe hits. The meteorological low-pressure area <i>Bernd</i> has hit Central Europe and made several rivers burst over their banks. Disastrous rain and floods are affecting large areas of Germany. Particularly endangered seems to be Armin Laschet's homestate, North Rhine-Westphalia. You are currently on vacation while the news breaks - your advisors recommend you to travel to the scenes of disaster instead.
A1: No, it would be improper to try to politicize this catastrophe. I’m of course making statements in support of the emergency responders, but I won’t go there myself just to get some pictures. I will rise above this opportunism.
F1: Some people appreciate the restraint, but you’re accused of missing in action - not the best quality for a chancellor candidate. Söder, in contrast, gets some nice pictures of him in rubber boots and positive media attention.
A2: This is absolutely horrible. I will travel to some of the affected regions, yes. However, I don’t want to abuse this situation for press coverage, I want to show restraint and talk in a more intimate setting to the affected.
F2: Your lowdown talks with the locals make you teary-eyed, and you’re certain to have shown yourself as an empathetic man. Söder, is quite a bit more bombastic in contrast - he gets the entire press corps to photograph him in rubber boots.
A3: Yeah, we definitely need to go there. Specifically, I want to visit the Green mayors of Wuppertal and Bonn. It is tragic and horrible, how this catastrophe had to remind us of climate change; when we protect our environment, we're protecting human lives, and with it, our open society.
F3: As a Green candidate, such a reaction was to be expected, and could come off as a bit hasty, but it’s clear how this situation can’t be disentangled from climate change. You show off your leadership, but without diverging from the party brand. Meanwhile, Söder takes the opportunity to get some nice pictures of him in rubber boots.
A4: Of course, I want to travel there, talk to affected people and show myself as a man of action. We need to listen to the people and help out with the cleanup - when disaster strikes, a chancellor should be there for the people.
F4: You have a good way with people and your folksy nature and stormproof northern accent play right into your reputation of a “Macher”. Söder is annoyed at being outshone. However, there are some who are annoyed how their politicians take every chance they can get to make a scene of themselves.

Q16:  Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear: 220 fatalities, 186 of those in Germany, the deadliest flood since 1962.
</br>The topic now changes back to climate change - it seems dire warnings of extreme weather events are starting to come true. As the Green Party, you are expected to make a statement on this.
A1: The Grand Coalition wasn't good enough at combating this crisis of a generation. We need concrete measures: there should be a climate task force in the federal government, headed by the Ministry of the Environment, who should be able to veto plans of other Ministries. There also has to be a rapid Climate protection program, with the crucial topic being the exit from coal until 2030.
F1: Some accuse you of wanting to politicize this disaster, but overall, you have the credentials to come out guns blazing here. Söder hastily concurs with you, but when talking about the climate, The Greens are still perceived as more competent. Coal-producing regions meanwhile aren’t happy about all parties abandoning their trade.
A2: Above all, the rescue of people's lives is most important. Afterwards, these regions have to get help, quickly and unbureaucratically. This catastrophe is not only the reason for climate change, there are different factors at play here - what we need to do is reform our flood protection programs.
F2: Some are happy about your lack of grandstanding, while others are irritated about how you won’t talk about climate change in the wake of this catastrophe. Even Söder comes out with an earlier date for the exit from coal, ironically outflanking you on this issue. Hopefully people can look through his opportunism.
A3: The increase of extreme weather events shows that the climate is getting warmer. Everything will get more extreme. Not just in the interest of coming generations, but on our own, we finally need to act on climate change. This is about a fundamental change in our course.
F3: Polls show, your party has the most credibility on climate issues. Without boasting, the discussion refocuses around your area of expertise, and your visionary tone reassures many people of your leadership. However, Söder also dashes forward with new, concrete proposals - you’re gonna have to stunt his momentum to end up on top.
A4: Of course, we need to do more against climate change. I’m happy that Söder is coming around, but I want to remind people: Bavaria, also an affected state, constantly imports dirty energy.  The reason is that Markus Söder refuses to build up other renewable energies than just solar. He might be good at talking about climate change, but he is not believable in his actions.
F4: It’s a bit cynical to attack your political opponent so shortly after a disaster, but stunting Söders perception as a climate activist is important. Pointing to his record makes him antsy, and you end up in a bruising exchange. Observers agree that, in the end, you have the upper hand here.

EQ6: Your state chapter in the Saarland seems to have some problems with their list. In a fiery brawl about who should lead the Green list there, after several resignations, former state party chair Hubert Ulrich seemed to have won the top spot against Green Youth chair Jeanne Dillschneider. The result was controversial, with party statutes nominally mandating a woman for the top spot - now, many are calling for action.
A1: We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.
F1: You personally travel to the Saarland in support of Dillschneider. It takes some convincing to the delegates from Ulrich’s district Saarlouis, but in a narrow vote, a list with her at the top is approved and sent to the electoral commission. This whole ordeal took valuable time from your calendar, but you might have averted a crisis here.
A2: We need to resolve this quickly. Let’s invest some resources for a re-vote, to get Jeanne Dillschneider the top spot.
F2: You personally travel to the Saarland in support of Dillschneider. Unfortunately, the re-vote doesn’t change the result. While you have to get back to the campaign trail, in a confusing matter, two lists are submitted - both are rejected by the Electoral Commission. Now the Greens won’t be on the ballot in the Saarland, and your efforts were for naught.
A3: There are certainly more pressing matters than some power plays in the small Saarland. Let them deal with it on their own, I want to concentrate on the national campaign.
F3: The Green Party of the Saarland holds a re-vote, excluding several delegates from Ulrichs district Saarlouis, so Dillschneider wins. Unfortunately, the electoral commission rules this procedure undemocratic and rejects their list - this means The Greens won’t be on the ballot in the Saarland! Hopefully the difference is small enough to not matter.
A4: Let’s not get derailed - make them change the statutes so Ulrich can stay in the top spot. The delegates democratically voted for him, so we’ll have to accept this result. We can deal with anything further after the election.
F4: Your intervention ends the argument with a change in the statues, but after you asserted yourself as chancellor candidate instead of Annalena, the whole debate about sexism comes up once again. Dillschneider retreats, personally offended. The whole affair is sure to deflate enthusiasm, particularly among women voters and the Green Youth.

Q17: It’s now less than two months until the election, and the campaign is heating up. It’s time to hit <b>The Campaign Trail</b>! In your travels around the country, what region do you want to focus your efforts on over the next few weeks?
A1: Me and Annalena are a team, and over the next weeks, I want to campaign as such. I’m going to visit her in her district in Potsdam, and I’m going to invite her back home to Schleswig-Holstein, where we’ll embark on a grand tour of Northern Germany.
F1: The ‘dynamic duo’ is back in action. Your party is hyped up at your mended relationship, and the sexism debate seems to have been buried for good. You receive a good reception back home in the North, but you also might help Annalena win a symbolic victory in her district - she’s going up against Olaf Scholz himself, after all.
A2: Winfried Kretschmann, the only Green Minister-President, has just won his reelection this spring and is very popular, particularly among moderates and conservatives. In order to broaden our appeal and show off competent Green governance, I want to campaign with him in Baden-Württemberg and South Germany in general.
F2: Kretschmann repeatedly showcased a recipe to win a general election as a Green - and your party has surprisingly good polling numbers in the South. By reaching out to moderate conservationists you might be able to catch the Söder-crowd right from under Laschet's feet.
A3: I’m quite content with our polling numbers in West Germany, but we are still far behind in East Germany. I don’t just want to be perceived as a chancellor of the west - to not get completely pummeled there, I want to focus my visits on the New States, to make them feel heard and activate traditional non-voters.
F3: The Greens are traditionally not very strong in the East, although half their official name stems from the former East German party <i>Alliance 90</i>. There are some promising enclaves in the big university cities, but the question remains if your message can reach into the disengaged countryside.
A4: The states of Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have their state elections parallel to our federal elections. To further our standing as a national party, a good result is crucial there. As such, let’s campaign with our top candidates, Bettina Jarasch and Anne Shepley, to show off the strength of our party!
F4: While you aren’t casting a broad net here, you do project strength, and the two candidates appreciate your help. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, you showcase your opposition to Nord Stream 2. Berlin is a traditional Green stronghold: you receive a heroes’ welcome in Kreuzberg.

Q18: August 2021: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. What should be done about that in your opinion?
A1: I am for the partial opening for vaccinated people. In this nation, freedoms aren't in need of justifications, their restrictions are. If there is no use for these restrictions, they have to go. We should be happy for the people who can now take more walks, who can be more free. We have the vaccine – if you want to be solidaric, you have to vaccinate yourself.
F1: Over time, this has been the preferred stance of most people - but it’s still a bit controversial on the political stage. There are concerns about this leading to a two-class society.
A2: I am against a vaccination mandate - in a free society, there is a right to become ill. We have to think about the consequences of untested vaccines. Furthermore, we shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead.
F2: There is a tiny fragment of society - the “natural medicine” crowd - that forms a swing voter block between Greens and AfD. Your stance appeals to those people - and those people only. Your party has to do damage control and forces you to retract, but among the catastrophic fallout, they are seriously wondering if Baerbock wasn’t the wiser choice. </br> Tread lightly.
A3: A vaccine mandate has unfortunately become necessary. Freedom's interpretation of the few can not lead to permanent restrictions of the freedoms of the many. We are tired of it. The people in this country are tired. A vaccine mandate can hold herd immunity in Germany high, so that this virus can be defeated.
F3: A vaccine mandate is pretty divisive. Your core voter base is open to this, but the majority still seems opposed. It unnerves liberals and young people in particular  - and, of course, you’re stirring the right-wing fear monger pot.
A4: Reason and freedom have to prevail, but we have to take the vaccines to the people, not the other way around. We should make it easier for mobile vaccination teams to vaccinate in front of the Aldi, the mosque or on the market place. Language- and information barriers have to be reduced more effectively.
F4: Your answer is uncontroversial, and your proposal proves to be quite popular. You’re still in the opposition and can’t affect a lot of policy, but dodging controversies might just be enough.

EQ7: A bit of a minor issue, but one that has gripped the imagination of many young voters is the topic of cannabis. Currently, it is a controlled substance, and illegal to produce, distribute or own. In light of worldwide movements to decriminalize or even legalize it: <i>Wann Bubatz legal</i>?
A1: Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.
F1: People detect a bit of a centrist pivot here. The Greens have been championing decriminalization and legalization throughout the last decade, and your new “small-step”-approach is certainly more careful than expected - activists are disappointed. Here’s hoping the inroads with suburban parents are worth it.
A2: We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.
F2: Many advised you to pivot to the center, to establish the Greens as a ‘Volkspartei’ - but this isn’t what they meant! Your oddly conservative stance gets a load of media attention, and your colleagues are horrified - individualism is a core tenet of the Greens! Shortly after you are forced to retract, and it’s embarrassing.
A3: Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.
F3: This has been a pet issue of Green activists for years, and as times are changing, many feel like with you as chancellor, there’s finally real hope for cannabis reform. Your reassurance energizes them and endears you to many younger voters, who you need to turn out. They’re certainly hoping for a “green” future.
A4: We don’t just want to legalize Cannabis, but also decriminalize small amounts of hard party drugs like XTC, cocaine and amphetamines. The criminalization of drug consumers is a relic from the last century, the ‘right for intoxication’ should be self-evident.
F4: Been to the <i>Berghain</i> one too many times, Robert? This stance is one discussed only in your party's urban chapters, and isn’t acceptable to even a majority of Greens. Scholz and Söder immediately jump on your eccentric comments - journalists discuss how the Greens might not be ready to lead after all.

Q19:  Throughout the campaign, Olaf Scholz and the SPD have tried to find their footing in the political landscape once more - but the momentum of your candidacy seems to have relegated them to the sidelines once and for all, at least for now. With the oldest party of Germany ailing away, what will be your strategy for the final few weeks of the campaign?
A1: With the Social Democrats demotivated as they are, we can set our sights onto Söder. I’m gonna emphasize how on climate action, he is all talk and no bite, as well as showing off our commitment to lead a sensible government.
F1: Söder is still quite popular, and stunting this sentiment is key to winning this race. Scholz has pretty much been neglected by the media for weeks - with him mostly out of the way, it’s up to you now to show off your “pragmatic idealism” in contrast to Söders shady tactics.
A2: It’s a good sign for us that the SPD is down in polls - but they’re still a formidable voting block. Their voters should be easiest to win over - let’s target them specifically by emphasizing our socio-economic program and consolidate the center-left around us.
F2: Most of your success does stem from voters who would’ve voted SPD before, and continuing that line to deliver the Coup-de-Grace really could hoist you over the top. However, be reminded that purely by its cultural impact, the core voter base of the SPD might stay loyal to their political home all the way to the end.
A3: It looks like Die Linke might struggle to reach the 5%-hurdle. I am clearly the best option for a leftist government - by pressing on this issue, we could keep them out of government and simplify finding a majority. Maybe it’ll even be enough for Green-Red!
F3: A lot of the core voters of Die Linke are unabashed socialists, but by gnawing at their margins, you really could knock them out of the Bundestag - as long as they don’t win a third direct mandate outside of Berlin. Let’s see if your gambit pays off.
A4: They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings.
F4: Your motives are admirable, but there are probably no two parties that have as little overlap as you and the AfD. Your attacks galvanize the Alternative’s base and hold little electoral potential in store.

Q20: A staple for every election season is the topic of taxes. </br>The Greens have an ambitious program with quite a few investments, particularly on climate change. Many people, particularly fiscal conservatives, wonder how you want to finance all those programs. In your next interview you’re asked frankly: do you want to raise taxes to achieve that?
A1: To finance necessary government spending, taxes on the rich have to be raised. We should reinstate the wealth tax and raise taxes on ecological grounds. However, no money that is earned by the state should be kept, it should be given back to the people. With richer people having a higher ecological footprint, the money gets redistributed to the poor. This is how we can balance the social impact of our reforms in our system.
F1: Your position is broadly similar to the leftist consensus, mirroring the SPD’s platform. Your ecological angle
A2: Effectively combating climate change is our number one priority, and to finance this, there might have to be certain tax increases on goods like meat or dairy. The wealthy will of course have to bear the highest increase, but everyone will have to contribute more - if we invest in our future, the financial effort will come back manifold.
F2: As much as you’re trying to spin this, you’re still promising to raise taxes. This might be sound economically, but people are worried that your plans might be too costly and might make animal products unaffordable. Parties to your right have an easy route of attack, while even your left accuses you of indifference towards less affluent people.
A3: We have to readjust our financial politics, to introduce a clause for internal improvements in our debt ceiling. We need a decade of investments to safeguard the climate, freedom and democracy. It is economically sound to abandon the ‘Black Zero’ on certain projects, especially considering the current interest rates.
F3: This is a sound argument that’s supported by Keynesian economists with broader appeal to the voters you have to win. However, since a 2/3rds majority and approval by the states is needed to modify the constitution, you’ll certainly be dependent on the SPD and even the Union to carry through after the election.
A4: Climate action doesn’t have to be expensive; particularly policies friendly to innovation, tax rebates for eco-friendly technologies and a higher CO²-price in emission trading can help us combat climate change without high expenditures. Of course, we are proposing more than that, but we’re sure that noticeable tax increases can be avoided.
F4: This sounds like a veiled offer to the FDP - who usually sits on the other side of the economic debate. Are The Greens undergoing a paradigm shift? After your fruitful alliance in the opposition, people seem to notice a small love affair between Greens and Liberals. Of course, SPD and Die Linke immediately take you to task on this, while Fundis are unnerved.

Q21: There are 7 parties poised to enter parliament, and none has ever won an absolute majority since Adenauer in 1957. As such, it is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. Particularly salient are Laschets attacks that you would govern with the socialist party Die Linke, equating their radicalism with the AfD. As such, you are asked ad-nauseam - who would you enter a coalition with?
A1: The CDU is slowing down at every corner, with topics that would find societal majorities. There are no answers that could come close to the urgency of the tasks ahead. While we definitely advocate for a stricter line on climate change, the party we have the most overlap with is the SPD. In the end, maybe it’ll even be enough for an alliance solely between Green and Red.
F1: It’s true that the SPD and Greens are each other's preferred coalition partners, even looking back to 7 years of Red-Green under Gerhard Schröder. However, the party system of Germany has changed, and most think it improbable that there will be a two-party-majority for the both of you - meanwhile, you’re dodging the question of cooperating with Die Linke.
A2: While we of course disavow any cooperation with the AfD, The Left has failed to quell doubts about their ability to govern. They would have to prove, in a particular way, that they are ready, by embracing NATO and the industrial core of this republic. The political task of our time is not in inciting a revolution, but to renew the foundations of trust.
F2: With this strong statement, you’re driving a harsher lane than Scholz, effectively silencing Laschet's attacks on you. This is certain to gather points among moderates, for many of whom this question was a hold-up to supporting you, but you also disappoint many younger voters and left-wingers in your base by disavowing leftist unity so frankly.
A3: In our political landscape, we can't keep thinking in binary bloques of Black-Yellow and Red-Green. That political world of the cold war is over, for now. We have to look at different majorities, consisting of three parties – a leftist alliance might be one option for us. If Die Linke proves that they are ready to take responsibility,
F3: This plays right into Laschet's criticisms of you, and no matter how you spin it, it frightens moderates fearful of the successor-party of the SED. On the other hand, Die Linke is hot on finally entering into a federal government - but their anti-interventionist stance is hard to ignore. Maybe your clear advances can help soften them up.
A4: This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition.
F4: You’ve taken a liking to the “Pasta-connection” of 2019, it seems. The FDP is more hesitant to reciprocate, but your message is clear - you’re looking for a Jamaica or a Traffic Light coalition. Since Die Linke might be hard to bargain with, this could be a cunning move of Realpolitik - just know, Lindner prefers the CDU as a partner.

EQ9: A defining social issue is the question of abortion. Currently, criminal law §218 disallows abortions generally, but decriminalizes them in case of rape, or if the pregnancy is under 12 weeks old. Additionally, §219a establishes an “ad ban” for doctors offering abortions. You’re asked for your stance on this controversial topic.
A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: Cautious, but realistic and solution-oriented. Feminism is one of the core tenets of Green politics, and your answer satisfies most advocates. The uncontroversial nature of this answer keeps the issue out of the limelight - that could be good, as conservatives concerned about climate change might still be in play for you.
A2: We want to strike $218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: A steadfast progressive answer with credibility: your party has advocated for this all the way back to its founding in 1980! You remain the preferred option of feminists in this race - but keep in mind this might fuel a counter reaction from the right. Your stance is also slightly to the left of Scholz’, which might be useful, depending on your strategy.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: Then why are you running in the first place, if it’s ‘fine as is’? Some colleagues are offended that you pushed aside a woman, just to spew what they see as antifeminist dog whistles - After all, the Greens were born from the New Social Movements of the 60’s and 70’s, feminism is a core tenet to them. Annalena shuns the media for a comment.
A4: We need to immediately strike § 218 and $ 219 - instead, the right to free, simple and accessible abortions has to be guaranteed; state-built hospitals should be required to perform the procedure. Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance.
F4: A strong stance that pivots leftwards - you really seem to gamble that by dragging culture wars into this race, you can consolidate the left around you. Your internet presence is already under siege from right-wing trolls. That said, your language echoes that of Die Linke in 2017, which might open you up to more attacks from the center.

Q22: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. Many loyal locals are left behind, as the Taliban are poised to make a comeback. The government is sharply criticized for its botched evacuation - what tone do you want to strike for your campaign in the wake of this situation?
A1: Berlin is once again pretending like nothing happened. Now, the SPD-led Foreign Ministry and the CDU-led Defense Ministry are constantly deflecting - it’s not true what the government said, that ‘no one could’ve known that the situation would escalate like this’. We need a foreign policy based on value-based realism, not disclaiming responsibility.
F1: You seem to gamble that joining the mudslinging is worth it - given how you really are the only major candidate whose party wasn’t involved in this tragedy, you might have a point. Hopefully, this can still translate at the ballot box in a few weeks.
A2: Something that poignantly showcased the lack of responsibility in this debacle is that everyone’s pointing fingers again. No one is in need of such an administration. Our soldiers have done their job, now, we need to do everything we can to bring them and their helpers to safety. We can not let them down, the clock is ticking.
F2: These are certainly tumultuous times - your calm demeanor and call for action contrast with the mudslinging between your opponents. While CDU and SPD blame each other for the failure, maybe your candor will be noted positively.
A3: The task in Afghanistan was to fight terror, in retrospect it's clear that this hasn't happened. We have suffered a military and moral defeat, by leaving behind ten thousand people who would have a right to seek asylum here. By continuing Deportations to Afghanistan, we’d export the death penalty - instead, we need an airlift. No seat in the planes can stay empty.
F3: This is a full-throated defense of a progressive refugee policy that’s appreciated by most of your voters. With several CDU and CSU politicians warning of another 2015, most prominently Söder, the battlelines are clearly set - although it’s unclear if the people in Afghanistan can be gotten to safety.
A4: We're seeing now that nation building hasn't worked. We need a new foreign policy strategy. We’ve been against this war in Afghanistan from the start - as Europeans, we should be more independent from the Americans and not involve ourselves in imperialist wars.
F4: The Green Party voted for the Afghanistan mission and was even part of the government in 2001. Usually, you’re known to be more hawkish - has Die Linke convinced you? Either way, your statement is promptly attacked from all sides as both unproductive and factually false.

Q23: September 2021: Official TV debates are a relatively recent phenomenon in Germany, only being consistently organized since 2002. Now, for the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Olaf Scholz and Markus Söder are all invited. What is going to be your strategy?
A1: Although he seems to lack behind me and Söder, Olaf Scholz is still our main competition for center-left voters. Let’s take the attack to him.
F1: Although Söder is clearly your main competition, if you can knock Scholz’s image down a peg, you might make further inroads into his base. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - now it’s up to you to make it count.
A2: Söder is my main competitor and retains a lot of goodwill from middle-of-the-road voters. Those are the people we have to win - if we can tarnish his image a bit, we can land on top.
F2: Although he espouses a variety of popular policies, Söder is still a man of many vulnerabilities. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - time to expose him for what he is.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America.
F3: You’ve enamored a lot of voters with your down-to-earth, rationalist attitude - maybe a positive, policy-focused tone will make chancellor Habeck stand out as the better option. Good luck!
A4: This format is clearly outdated and does not make for a fair and substantial debate. The media have treated me and my party with constant discrimination. If we want to change up the system, I can not relegate myself to participate in this charade.
F4: Many question your judgment. The debate goes ahead without you - the Triell becomes another duel between SPD and CDU, as it was in the past. The media hasn’t really treated you as anything lesser, so in refusing this historic opportunity, you look like a clown. Söder and Scholz seem to tie, but the big headlines are about your attitude.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. There are plenty of avenues to attack him and diminish his standing even further -  which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: As vice chancellor of the Grand coalition, Scholz epitomizes continuation. The SPD in government has become tired and drained from ideas for the future. Olaf Scholz wants to prolong the habits of the Merkel Era, to depoliticize politics. The Greens stand for a change in our political culture instead.
F1: Despite competing for the same voters, Scholz didn’t expect an attack from you - however, his disavowal of a continuation of the GroKo defuses your criticism a bit. Söder is pleased with your focus, but still gets baited into placatingly defending the status quo. Overall, both of you have a solid performance, while Scholz stands out as rather bland.
A2: Olaf Scholz has a lot to answer for. Despite the warning lights shining for a long time, he failed to deal with the Causa Wirecard and the cum-ex banking scandal, as well as making crucial mistakes during the protests against the G20 meeting as mayor of Hamburg.
F2: It seems a bit vicious of you to attack his integrity outright, especially since you might end up as coalition partners, but you do put Scholz on the defensive. Söder, not thinking Scholz to be a threat, instead takes on a more positive tone - something voters seem to prefer nowadays. Polls show him to be the winner of the Triell.
A3: His rhetoric on climate change may be well-meaning, but it’s a diversion from the unambitious program of the SPD. They don’t have concepts like we do talking about the social consequences of climate change and have often been slow on climate policy, particularly with the exit from coal. Scholz’s stance on climate action is dishonest.
F3: Some biting criticism from your side, but for many people, it does ring true. Scholz tries to defend his party’s record in government, but climate policy is the one topic where your party is perceived most competently - if it wasn’t for Söder, who is also happy sparring with you two over fiscal sensibilities. He takes away a narrow win, with you in second place.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a pragmatic idealist to rise above the pack.
F4: You seem a bit nervous and impatient, but surprisingly, you manage well enough. Your no-bullshit attitude plays well among the Germans, who aren’t used to someone being as frank as you are. That said, it’s definitely noted among some how unprepared you seemed - Söder takes away a slight win.

EQ10: Along with the <i>Triel </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i> Vierkampf </i>. While you have eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Paul Zymiak of the CDU (since the CSU is heading the Union ticket through Söder), debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, considering the polling.
A2: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If they match or surpass their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Paul Zymiak made a strong case for Markus Söder as the pragmatic heir to the Merkel era. This might drive more votes towards him, and unites the Union firmly behind the Bavarian.
A4: Let's see who can come out on top – it won't change much either way.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…

Q25: The 26th of September is almost here. This has been a wild ride, and come what may, the Greens will have had a moment that will be talked about years from now. Hopefully, it hasn’t passed yet! In the final days of the campaign, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: Luisa Neubauer, the famous Fridays For Future activist, is a member of our party, but she’s been inactive. Maybe we can change that - I want to ask her to appear with us, in an official statement of support. I want to speak to the German youth that brought us where we are today, in some rallies all across Germany’s cities.
F1: Unfortunately, she refers to FFF’s party neutrality and refuses to appear with you, although she appreciates the outreach. Instead, you’re doing your rallies with an assortment of longtime Green heavyweights like Claudia Roth, Anton Hofreiter and Jürgen Trittin. Now, time to join your family in Flensburg and hope for “Germany. Everything is possible”
A2: Annalena, despite some minor issues, has been a loyal and effective co-party-leader at my side - it’s only fair to appear with her before this monumental moment. I want to invite her home to my Northern love, Schleswig-Holstein, and appear in a gigantic rally in my native city of Lübeck, the hanseatic capital.
F2: You energize the entire party for a historic win tonight. Your youthful dynamic on stage makes many voters curious about a Green-led government, and the reception in front of the Holstentor is enormous. From there, it’s not a far trip home to your family in Flensburg. Good luck that your pitch will be just as effective in all of “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A3: There will be state elections in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern parallel to the federal elections. To project confidence and strength, I want to appear with Bettina Jarasch in Berlin to help make her the second Green head of state government. This is only the beginning of a Green decade in Europe!
F3: Jarasch is happy that you’re helping in her efforts to turn the capital Green. Berlin is already a stronghold for your party, and you can be certain to pick up some more direct mandates there. From there, it’s time to buckle up with your family in Flensburg, and to find trust in the voters of “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A4: Winfried Kretschmann is the only Green Minister-President and a very important figure of the Realo-wing. If we want to win this thing, we’ll have to reach out towards the center, and he knows how. Let’s ask him to appear with us across South Germany.
F4: The <i>Minischderbräsident</i> of Baden-Württemberg is positively surprised, but campaigns enthusiastically for your cause. Hopefully, this can net you some strong results in both urban and rural regions of the South. Now, it’s time to head home to Flensburg, and hope you’re supported by the median voter in “Germany. Everything is possible”.

Alternative zu Q8 falls Social Media in Frage 1
Q26: At the onset of this campaign, you decided to return to Twitter and Facebook. However, you’ve once again come under fire for a tweet in which you compare Söder to a third-world strongman. This is not the first time you’ve made such bizarre statements on social media - some years ago, you had implied that Bavaria is a one-party state and Thuringia is not democratic. How do you want to react?
A1: It was a mistake to return to social media, it’s just not good for my temperament and our democratic discourse - I apologize for the remark and delete my accounts, this time for good.
F1: You retreat with your tail between your legs, and it’s a bit embarrassing for you. It’s good to draw consequences, but some voters question if you’re the right person to represent Germany if you can’t stop yourself from making these statements.
A2: First, I want to personally apologize to Markus Söder - I should have chosen my words more carefully. Then, I will delete that particular tweet. I can’t go back from social media, but from now on, I want my twitter account to be run by a team that double-checks my tweets.
F2: Söder publicly accepts the apology. The media debates about your erratic tendencies for a few days, but afterwards quickly moves on. Let’s hope that from now on, your team gives you some duly needed feedback before you tweet out stuff like this.
A3: People keep taking my words out of context - they might sound bad if you only hear a half-sentence, but overall, I stand by the gist of what I said. Markus Söder cares mostly for power, and uses his convictions primarily to get elected, instead of enacting change.
F3: Doubling down is seen as inappropriate by most, and CDU/CSU politicians attack you harshly over your defamatory comments in the coming days. Söder himself refrains from commenting, but he does seem to be personally offended. Your party isn’t amused either and convinces you to have a team check all your tweets before you publish them.
A4: I recognize that my tweet was inappropriate and apologize for it. However, I want to to stay there, for purposes of recordkeeping. Censorship can not be the answer in our political discourse - as such, I reserve myself the right to keep writing whatever comes to mind. In this day and age, authenticity is the key to success.
F4: While your apology is accepted, the party is not thrilled about you potentially ruining the campaign with erratic tweets. You don’t repeat the same mistake, but with your uncensored style of fast paced tweets the media draws some nasty Trump-comparisons which you certainly have no use for.

Q27: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Markus Söder, Minister-President of Bavaria and chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. He’s widely known for his opportunistic power plays, but also seemingly commands respect for his ideological vacillations. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: Markus Söder knows how to score cheap political points. What we need in Germany is moral decency! He sidesteps conflicts, he solves them through the backroom, and does not possess the responsibility to act beyond his own self interests. We need a chancellor with a strong moral compass who isn’t afraid to make politically unpopular decisions.
F1: The issue is, people still see Söder as authentic in this regard - he claims his positions merely evolve when new information comes along. This quality is one that he seems to share with Merkel, who had her own heel turns over the years. Your criticism doesn’t land perfectly, while Scholz has a nice performance on his own - he and Söder tie, with you in third place.
A2: On climate change, Markus Söder's record is dishonest. His goals might be sensible - but his measures are unsubstantial. He talks about energy transitions, but doesn't force the build-up of renewable energy. He is for nuclear energy, but woe me waste is stored in Bavaria. Tree-hugging and putting up bee hives does not equate to environmentalism - Söders pretensions clash with reality.
F2: He hits right back, defending his record in Bavaria while calling your proposals unaffordable and prohibitory. You continue to aggressively spar over this topic, with Scholz unable to even interject - but while you’re a great communicator, Söders way of doing things seems to hit a nerve. Unfortunately, polls give him an edge.
A3: For the last 16 years, this country has suffered under the failings of the CSU. Markus Söder is emblematic of his party and their governing style. Missing concepts, no answers given; “back to normality“ of past times instead of looking forward. The Greens stand for change and a politics that goes beyond the Status Quo of Seehofer and Scheuer.
F3: Söder may be popular, but his party is a weak point - nationally, the work of the CSU is largely synonymous with dogmatic conservatism and incompetency. Söder tries to present himself as more than just a continuation of the Merkel years - but you seemingly seem to take away a win over him, with Olaf Scholz surprisingly not far behind.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of both candidates, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a pragmatic idealist to rise above the pack.
F4: You seem a bit nervous and impatient, but surprisingly, you manage well enough. Your no-bullshit attitude plays well among the Germans, who aren’t used to someone being as frank as you are. That said, it’s definitely noted among some how unprepared you seemed - Söder takes away a slight win.

Q28: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the Green program, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: The CDU/CSU has been in government for 16 years, the SPD for 8. A “back to normality” isn’t a desirable outcome - The Greens are designing politics beyond the Status Quo, we aren’t just administrators of standstill. If you vote for a Green chancellorship, you know things will change: we’ll give our society back its confidence and ability to act.
F1: Your pitch is received decently by viewers and pundits alike. While some believe you could’ve been more assertive, between the Vice Chancellor of the current government and the CSU party chair, you really do stand for a change in direction, as a refreshing new option for the country. Polling shows you to be the winner of the Triell.
A2: The situation is serious. We need more engagement with climate change, no politics of hold-up. If we wait any further, it will be expensive - not just environmentally, but also in our wealth and our freedom. The only way forward is ambitious climate action, with renewable energy, a higher price on CO² and technology investments.
F2: Your plea is passionate and authentic, but perhaps, also expected. Söder is stoked about an issue-focused Triell, and while Scholz is boring as always, your insightful and respectful discourse about the correct way to fight climate change is applauded by journalists all over the spectrum. The people concur: both of you had a great showing that night.
A3: Climate change is a social question. We have a growing inequality in this country that is threatening social peace and our prosperity. We need to change the system and take big corporations to task, with reforms to the debt ceiling and our tax system, as well as concepts to involve low earners in monetary earnings from higher CO²-prices.
F3: A great way to showcase the renewed image of The Greens. Olaf Scholz concurs, but in your passion, your attacks on Söders economic plans register more strongly than his presence. Nonetheless, flanked by two Leftists, he manages to consolidate his base as the conservative underdog. You end up in a tie along ideological lines.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. If no one can see how dire the situation really is, we have to take Söder and Scholz to task over their failed administrations. Years and years of standstill, and these just won’t admit that we need change. Someone has to stand up and fight!
F4: Your patience has failed you, it seems. At first, your brash, no-bullshit attitude is perceived as authentic and surprisingly refreshing, but as the mudslinging continues, the “evil look” on your eyes makes most voters a bit hesitant about you leading diplomatic talks on their behalf. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz’s unwavering calmness really catches on with them.

Richtungsfrage Links
EQ3: There’s been some media chatter, even fear mongering about you in the press. Even though you’re traditionally a Realo, you’ve been uncompromising in your leftist stances - some see this unwavering integrity as a recipe for success, while others believe it could be a detriment. In an internal meeting you’re asked frankly: “Is this the way our party should follow?”
A1: I stand by my course: 2011, 2018 and 2019 showed us how Germany is fed up with the excuses on climate change. On this issue, our politics has lost all links to reality, because it’s not radical enough. We can not decide against all the knowledge and all the facts about climate change, we need to do something!
F1: By sticking to your guns on climate, your core voters are mobilized, singing out the message far and wide. Other voters do still care about other topics though - as long as you can combine the enthusiasm around you with a broader appeal to change, your momentum could sweep you right into first place.
A2: Stateliness and radicalism aren’t opposites! To really change something, we can’t just swallow the unshackling of global capitalism. We decided on taxing the rich as a party, but we’d be crazy if we didn’t think on a grander scale: instead of arguing about the instruments, we need to ask some critical questions about our economic system!
F2: Some old Greens are warmly reminded of the rowdy, maoist 1960’s - but as they snap back to reality, even they fear how this rhetoric might land in the center of society. The Union immediately starts its fear mongering around you as a “radical ecosocialist” - and your prospects for a coalition with them or the FDP plummet.
A3: Look, I get it. We need to win societal and parliamentary majorities, so that our country becomes more just. If that means tampering our rhetoric a bit, so be it. It is our job to provide a good offer for the progressive-left center of this country, and while that includes classically leftist answers, it also goes beyond them.
F3: Your pivot back to the center is noted by the media - while some activists are wary, the base is rallied sufficiently already. Your course-correction could prevent the worst among centrists, as long as you stay your course, but try not to seem like a political opportunist.

Richtungsfrage Rechts
EQ3: Since the beginning of your leadership, the Green party was observed to have moved to the center. While some believe you’re finally ready to be regarded as a “Volkspartei”, others are fearful that you’re eroding their identity, similar to the SPD. In a tense internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: “Is this the way our party should follow?”
A1: Ideology isn’t that important to me. I want to answer questions on important issues: what about older people in rural areas, what about the education system, the origins of poverty? We need to listen to different people; environmental protection, social justice and economic prosperity don’t contradict themselves. As a modern party, let us cast a broad net.
F1: Casting a broad net is important, but there is significant concern about your leadership among Fundis. If you can overcome the internal quarrels though, your pitch might be well received by voters. Despite everything, Markus Söder even remarks that he could imagine a productive cooperation between you two.
A2: Look, ecological goals don’t just have to be ambitious, they have to be reachable, and affordable. We need to leave the image of a “prohibitory party” behind us - frankly, we have failed in the past with tax-raising-debates - instead we should support sensible, workable policies. Work from within the system - sticking to dogma doesn’t get us anywhere.
F2: The few Fundis that are still left take this as a direct slight towards them - Robert can contain a leadership challenge only at the last minute. To the media, this confirms your ongoing pivot to the Right: While you do hit the nerve of some voters, the Animal Protection Party also seems to gain traction these days, especially among students.
A3: I wanted to broaden our appeal by showing how we’re open to all of society, open to other arguments. That said, our party needs a strongly defined profile, I agree. In the coming campaign, we should increasingly emphasize our environmentalism and center-left attitude.
F3: Many op-eds notice an increasing discrepancy between your past rhetoric and the new election posters you’re on. You seem like a bit of a flip-flopper - although your party members continue to defend you vehemently. Hopefully the voters won’t care.

HABECK - GEDULDSFRAGE
Wenn Patience unter 15:
EQ8: It may sound like a trivial question, but it has become a strangely often discussed topic to talk about your way of clothing. You've been known to dislike ties, instead often taking on a bit of a... „disheveled“ look – including holes in your socks, worn pullovers, jute bags and your unkempt stubble. One journalist believes your negligent outfit indicates a negligent political style.
Wenn Patience unter 5:
A1: Ugh! Yes, no, well… Where's the question?
F1: Robert Habeck is pissed off. The rest of the interview is just as tense. The campaign has put a toll on your patience – and it quickly makes the rounds. The public asks itself: are you really up to the task of chancellor? For the rest of the campaign, your bizarre appearance undercuts your optimism, with your popularity plummeting.
Wenn Patience unter 10:
A1: Campaigning is no easy feat. For ten days, I haven't done the dishes. The trash hasn't been put out. The milk is empty. This morning I ate cereal with water, no shit.
F1: I'm sorry man, but this is how politics works. It takes over your whole life. People notice how you've gained some weight. They feel sorry. Sorry that you're putting yourself through this – but they'd rather keep you away from the chancellery if the campaign trail is already putting you through the wringer like this.
Wenn Patience unter 15:
A3: This is sort of a Green tradition, isn't it? Instead of wearing brand new clothing, I am trying to live a mostly sustainable lifestyle, saving on ressources. You could call it a political statement, of sorts.
F3: It's been 40 years since the first Green MP's entered the Bundestag with sneakers and sweaters instead of suit and tie. And yet – try to spin in as much as you want, many people want more regality from a chancellor candidate, and Scholz and Söder seem much more stately than you in your casual attire.
Wenn Patience größergleich 15:
EQ11: Some good press for you. On your recent travels, several journalists have noted and written op-eds about how attentive and patient you are, when listening to people of different viewpoints. Your down-to-earth attitude really seems to gather respect, even among political opponents.
A1: For all of us, we have to have tolerance to the counter argument. The auto workers, the coal workers, the conventional agriculturists who fear too much environmentalism, they have a right to bring forth their arguments. And we are well advised to listen to these people, to further the living discourse of democracy.
F1: You uphold your reputation of a great listener and negotiator. Even people who never would've considered voting for a Green before nowadays seem to begrudgingly hold some respect for your pragmatism. This ability may very well be your key to the chancellery this fall.



Q14:
It’s a bit of a minor issue, but a passage from a book of yours, that you “have little use for love for the Fatherland”, and that “patriotism makes [you] vomit”, has repeatedly been quoted on social media, and sparingly even by some candidates to your right. Do you want to clarify this misunderstanding?
A1: So what? Patriotism is a dead concept of the 20th century. We do not have use for it nowadays. We need to think internationally, and finally throw off the shackles of nationalism in Germany, especially in light of what the AfD is saying these days.
F1: Why are you throwing oil on this fire? Your comments were taken out of context from a book where you explicitly <i>espoused</i> a leftist patriotism! You’re right that this is a bit of a dodgy topic in Germany, but you literally vindicate your worst critics - expect a drop in the polls.
A2: This passage is from a book about “leftist patriotism” I wrote eleven years ago, and every serious politician knows that it’s abhorrently taken out of context. I don’t want to throw this comment back into the spotlight, let them say whatever they want.
F2: Most journalists know that this statement doesn’t amount to anything and stay clear. However, several politicians continue using it despite its misleading nature, sowing a nasty reputation about you among gullible voters on social media.
A3: I apologize, these sentences are definitely misleading as to my real position. Today, I wouldn’t write it like that.
F3: It’s a bit bleeding heart to apologize for an out-of-context quote from 11 years ago, and your opponents continue using it as a line of attack. Still, the few questions about this coming from the media will be satisfyingly answered now.
A4: These comments are taken wildly out of context, as anyone would see when looking at the actual passage. I have since come to see how we need to adopt a “leftist patriotism”, to positively relate to our society. Flag and anthem are not courtesy of the right wing populists, leftist parties also have to care about a sense of unity and home.
F4: You really double down on clarifying this quote it seems - and it works. Your push for a new, liberal-progressive type of patriotism gets renewed attention and is quite well received among the moderates you need to win. Any criticism coming from your opponents are quelled, and you’ve seemingly improved the Greens’ image.

Falls Baerbock antagonisiert:
Q17: It’s now less than two months until the election, and the campaign is heating up. It’s time to hit <b>The Campaign Trail</b>! In your travels around the country, what region do you want to focus your efforts on over the next few weeks?
A1: Me and Annalena are a team, and over the next weeks, I want to campaign as such. I’m going to visit her in her district in Potsdam, and I’m going to invite her back home to Schleswig-Holstein, where we’ll embark on a grand tour of Northern Germany.
F1: The ‘dynamic duo’ is back in action - or is it? People notice how you just don’t seem to click quite as much as you did. The press points to your disagreements at the start of the campaign, and speculates about some leftover resentment. Nevertheless, Annalena gives it her best and the tour is a moderate success.

Q25 The 26th of September is almost here. This has been a wild ride, and come what may, the Greens will have had a moment that will be talked about years from now. Hopefully, it hasn’t passed yet! In the final days of the campaign, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A2: Annalena, despite some differences between us, has been a loyal and effective co-party-leader at my side - it’s only fair to appear with her before this monumental moment. I want to invite her home to my Northern love, Schleswig-Holstein, and appear in a gigantic rally in my native city of Lübeck, the hanseatic capital.
F2: You energize the entire party for a historic win tonight. Although she does seem to be a bit disappointed about her missed opportunity, your reception in front of the Holstentor is still respectable. From there, it’s not a far trip home to your family in Flensburg. Good luck that your pitch will resonate in all of “Germany. Everything is possible”.


Falls in Ostdeutschland campaigned:
Q19: Throughout the campaign, Olaf Scholz and the SPD have tried to find their footing in the political landscape once more - but the momentum of your candidacy seems to have relegated them to the sidelines once and for all, at least for now. With the oldest party of Germany ailing away, what will be your strategy for the final few weeks of the campaign?
A4: They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings.
F4: Your motives are admirable, but there are probably no two parties that have as little overlap as you and the AfD. That said, your personal talks to many people in East Germany did turn some heads - keep at it with the listening, maybe something will change.


Statt Q8, falls:

-> did not Q2A1
-> did three of the following:
Q2A4,
Q3A2,
Q4A3,
Q5A4,
EQ2A3,
Q7A2:


EQ2: April 2021: It’s getting serious. Even though the Greens have slipped in their momentum, you are still in second place, and the big question presents itself: The chancellor’s question. Annalena has her own ambitions, you know that - although the public seems to know you better. The party now expects you two to discuss it among yourselves who is going to become its standard bearer for the 2021 Election.
A1: Annalena, look: Politics in this country is brutal. Between boulevard-journalists and ruthless conservatives, they’re gonna jump on an ambitious person like you.The people, unfortunately, still seek one thing above all: strength. I’m gonna be frank; <i>a woman can’t win this race.</i> I wish it was different, but it isn’t. If The Greens are to be taken seriously, we have to be honest with ourselves here!
F1: Be glad this ain’t the Democratic primaries, or you’d call her a liar on national TV. <br> Annalena is appalled at your comment. She retorts that precisely because of this, a woman has to run - and reminds you, that the <i>current chancellor is a woman</i>. You can’t really argue with that, and when the party elites stand by her, you have to acquiesce. She’s got the candidacy.
A2: I don’t want anything more than to serve this republic as chancellor. But I also don’t want to make this difficult. We can’t afford the perception to throw away our principles of Gender equality just for the sake of power. You’re passionate, determined and ready for sacrifices - you need to do it, Annalena.
F2: It’s the most painful day of your political career: you’re leaving the prospect of a Green-led government in her hands. The media is surprised how gracefully you’ve handed her the chancellor candidacy, but with a united party, Annalena knocks the rollout out of the park, with a positive media reception to her nomination.
A3: I don’t like to be this cynical, but at the end of the day, it’s a numbers game. My polling looks good, while the people barely know you, Annalena. That’s going to change - but if we want to govern, we need to win, and we can’t take any chances with unknown variables. The people know me, we can work from there. And if I can’t make it, you’ll be popular enough by the next election to take over.
F3: It rankles Annalena, but she doesn’t want to squander the opportunity for a historic win. There are a few back and forths, but at the end of the day, she’s pragmatic enough to see your point. The announcement comes a few days delayed, with speculations of a rift, but as you come forth, united behind your candidacy, the reception is positive.
A4: This isn’t just about the election Annalena, but also about leading a cabinet, a government, a country! In Schleswig-Holstein, I’ve shown how to lead the ecological transformation of our economy forwards. I’ve walked the walk in coalition talks, successfully. You are a capable woman, and you’re of course going to get a post, but this chancellor thing, you need to know your way around the executive.
F4: A very pragmatic take from you. Annalena steadfastly believes she can do it, but behind the scenes, some of the party bosses see your point. After a few tense days, she gives in, agreeing to serve in your cabinet instead. The media speculates about a rift between you, but as you come forth, united behind your candidacy, the reception turns positive.

A4: In hindsight, maybe we need the visibility after all. I’m going to rejoin Twitter and Facebook and post regular announcements, my appearances in debates and talk shows as well as standard campaign rhetoric. Better too late than not at all, I suppose.
F4: It’s true, and your new accounts immediately gain tons of followers, becoming a valuable recruitment tool for new party members. However, your flip-flop is still perceived as inconsistent and opportunistic - and you also notice how it takes a toll on your mental health. Perhaps that’s the price one pays for being a politician in the 21st century.

A5: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the Greens have a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F5: Merz competently rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show some backbone and confidence to your party. Now, it’s time now to huddle down in your home in Flensburg, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of governing “Germany. Everything is possible”.
A6: Okay, hear me out. This campaign needs a wildcard. This whole time, the Greens are always portrayed as “woke” or something. We could really turn some heads if we show that we’re serious about my pivot on refugees, and there’s only one person in our party who could do that: Boris Palmer.
F6: Robert, that’s, that’s a joke… right? …no? Alright shit, Michael, it’s too late to swap in Baerbock now, just give him the appearance and we’ll try to bury it. What, the media already got wind of it? Oh god… okay, Robert, play it off as “reconciliation” and “talking with everyone”, okay? Those media people will rip you a new one… this truly is “Germany. Everything is possible”.
