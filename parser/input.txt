Greens-Habeck

Q1: March 2023: You and your Party Co-Leader, Annalena Baerbock, want to decide together who will be the Green Party chancellor candidate in around a month. Until then, what do you want to do to prepare for the upcoming election season?
A1: Two years ago, I deleted my social media accounts. However, in this day and age, you need social media for a successful election campaign. I will reactivate them and start posting!
F1: It’s true that social media is almost expected today, so this probably helps - as long as you avoid posting controversial statements like the ones that made you deactivate your accounts in the first place!
A2: If I want to become chancellor, I can’t be dragged down by unnecessary scandals. I’ll make sure my finances are in order and will check if there are any problems with my website or other things on the internet.
F2: Despite thoroughly searching for potential problems, you just don’t find anything. This feels like a waste of time, especially considering you could have used the time to campaign or do something else more useful.
A3:  I want to get out there, go to talk shows, give interviews, and generally make sure the German people know me. This should improve both my name recognition and my favourability ratings.
F3: It helps to be seen, and a few more people get to know you, though most Germans already have an opinion of you.
A4: Friday for Future is capable of mobilizing a massive amount of people. I will visit some demonstrations and meet with their leadership to get them on our side.
F4: In the past, the Green Party has been criticized by Fridays for Future for not being ambitious enough. This might help mobilise the youth vote, though many people who care about the climate a lot already vote Green.

Q2: The Corona Pandemic is the topic that is dominating the news and political discourse right now. With the Greens not governing on the federal level, you can do little in terms of actual policy though. What’s something you want to focus on concerning COVID policies?
A1: Overall, we support the government’s policy. I will criticize their sometimes chaotic response but also make it clear that we broadly stand behind all necessary measures.
F1: You don’t make headlines with this stance, but this is broadly popular and you don’t attract any negative attention, as most Germans seem to agree.
A2: Since the beginning of the pandemic, there hasn’t been enough of a focus on children and families. We will present a plan to get them back to school quickly and provide financial aid for them.
F2: This is a decent avenue of attack, many feel that the needs of children have not been adequately met, though you are not the best person to sell this. Young voters are also a core group of your coalition.
A3: While the lockdowns were absolutely necessary at the beginning of the pandemic, we should be mindful - there has to be a balance between freedom and safety.
F3: The FDP agrees with your position, and you might win over some of their voters - however, many others feel that this might be premature.
A4: Every district association of the Green Party is led more competently than this country. We need to do something to combat the lack of ideas on the federal level. The Green Party stands for a new beginning.
F4: Many people agree that this country needs change and this is a damaging attack - it’s unclear though how many people prefer the Green Party as an alternative.

Q3: April 2021: You’ve come to an agreement with your co-party leader Baerbock. In a bit of a surprise to you, she told you that she has no interest in becoming chancellor candidate and wants to support you. Now, it’s time for your first speech as the official Green chancellor candidate!
A1: When I was Minister of Agriculture and the Environment in Schleswig-Holstein, I listened to all people and strived to find compromises. As Chancellor, I want to continue this approach!
F1: Your time as Minister was widely regarded as a success. The left wing of your party is not happy to hear the word ‘compromise’, though in general, it helps to be seen as pragmatic. With both the CDU and SPD struggling in the polls, many people consider you as the best alternative.
A2: Forty years ago, the Green Party was founded to make our politics care more about the environment. more about the environment. Today, I continue in this tradition, as the only candidate that truly takes climate change seriously.
F2: A strong focus on climate change will mobilize your core voters. It’s unclear if that’s enough to win - however, with the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls, an energized campaign might be the way to go. And as you know - 'There's no way around the climate goals'.
A3: After eight years of Grand coalition and sixteen years of CDU chancellorship, this country needs change. I’m the right man to give this country the new start it needs.
F3: A compelling argument, many voters desire change, and with the CDU and SPD both struggling in the polls right now, you might be able to deliver it in the fall. As you know: 'Future doesn't happen - we're creating it.'
A4: We have a historic opportunity to win the chancellorship for the Green Party this election. I want to be a chancellor for everyone and promise to focus on sensible reform and proposals.
F4: You seem to gamble that the left, 'Fundi'-wing of the Party is truly dead and that this race is won in the middle. As both big parties, CDU and SPD seem to struggle, there might be an opening to split them apart - but be mindful of your base.

Q4: After a messy leadership contest, the CDU has - somewhat unexpectedly - chosen Markus Söder as their chancellor candidate and immediately stopped sliding in the polls, after they had lost support earlier when some of their MPs got caught selling overpriced medical masks. With this, you, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have all chosen a chancellor candidate. Now it's time to decide on a general strategy for this pivotal race.
A1: It’s clear that the SPD is not going to win this election. I want to present myself as the candidate of the left-of-centre and try to coalesce left-wing voters around the Greens.
F1: Voters on the Left have traditionally been your base. Some pundits wonder though if such an unexceptional approach is the right way to capitalize on the Greens' newfound polling highs, especially with the SPD down to not much more than their very core voters. Let's hope you're ready for the onslaught of attacks from the right.
A2: Traditionally, the Greens have been a left-of-centre party. However, to actually win this, we need to draw voters from the CDU, especially with Söder as their nominee.
F2: The core base of the CDU might be impossible to crack, and attacks from your left follow swiftly. You blunt the impact of Söders’ momentum, though for now, most voters prefer him to you.
A3: Our base is largely young, urban, and well-off. We will put our resources into mobilizing them and getting the youth to turn out his election.
F3: Your turnout-focused strategy might get more first-time voters and loyal Greens to the polls, but this might not be enough to get you into first place. In the last election, the electorate skewed older, and your core base only netted you around 8.9%.
A4: Our polling numbers in West Germany are great, but we are struggling to even get to 10% in many East German states. There is an untapped voter potential for us there, so let’s focus on East Germany.
F4: Until now, the Green Party message didn't seem to resonate with East Germany, though the region is known for low turnout in general. Maybe you can get some people there to vote Green this time?

Q5: With a Green chancellor now looking like a realistic option, many are curious about your foreign policy. Can you clarify your position on that?
A1: The USA is our strongest ally outside of Europe and we want to increase cooperation with both them and NATO. While we disagree on some things - like the 2% goal - we also want to go further than the current government, by stopping the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F1: It seems like you are trying to outflank the CDU with your pro-USA stance. With Söder being criticized for visiting Putin last year, this could be an opening. Just be mindful not to scare off too many voters that are critical of the USA.
A2: We need a more active foreign policy. While pacifism is still the ideal that should guide us, we have to do more - for example, we should deliver defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the defend themselves against the Russian-backed separatists.
F2: In the future, this position will surely be vindicated. For now though, it goes too far for the average voter and especially for the more pacifist-minded part of the electorate that often votes Green.
A3: The Green Party has always been the party of pacifism. We need to drastically reduce our military spending and rethink our relationship with NATO. There are more important things we can spend this money on.
F3: 30 years ago, this would have been a mainstream position within your party. Now, it’s on the fringe, and a worldview too simplistic for the median voter. Even the SPD needles you on your stance towards NATO - you might, however, gain from the Left, if that's your goal.
A4: We don’t want to rock the boat here. I want to reaffirm our commitment to NATO but also emphasize that diplomatic solutions are always preferable to military conflicts.
F4: People really don't know what to make of this vagueness - you also don’t differentiate yourself from other parties. At least you keep some flexibility for future policy.

Q6: May 2021: The Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act as unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. The federal government in Berlin is now working on passing a stricter law. While the government can pass the law without Green Party votes, the media is still interested in your position.
A1: We need to reduce our emissions by 70% by 2030 - to achieve that, we have to do a lot. For example, we need to double the tempo of the expansion of renewable energy.
F1: As expected, you’re strongly pushing for more ambitious plans - this strong statement resonates with the voters who are sympathetic to you and energizes your campaign.
A2: Every democratic party here agrees that something needs to be done, so let’s find solutions together. We want to work with other parties, though they finally have to take the climate crisis seriously!
F2: You’re emphasizing consensus here - on the one hand, that might make coalition talks after the election easier, on the other, your core voters hoped for more. At least you make it clear that they need to move towards your position.
A3: For the next government, climate change has to be the top priority. Therefore, we want to form a dedicated ministry for climate policy to coordinate our efforts better.
F3: There's some talk in the beltway about how practicable it would be to dedicate such a cross-sectional task to one personality, but most just want something to be done. Also, you make some people think that you’ve already given up on becoming chancellor and want to run for climate minister instead.
A4: The new law the Grand coalition has come up with is simply not enough. We need an end to environmentally-unfriendly subsidies, a higher price for CO2, and to transform the traffic and agricultural sector to achieve the necessary reductions in emissions.
F4: In general, voters like to hear concrete proposals. While your base likes them a lot, other voters are a lot more sceptical. In the future, you should try to mostly emphasize your more popular proposals.

Q7: After announcing your candidacy, you’ve received some criticism from within the party for stealing the nomination from a woman - in general, the Green Party is very in favour of giving top jobs to women if possible. How do you want to address these allegations?
A1: This was a decision we made together, and Baerbock and I agreed that I would be the most competent candidate. Besides, it’s kinda sexist to say that she should have gotten the nomination just because she’s a woman.
F1: You’re not helping yourself with these kinds of comments. Baerbock is popular in the party and time and energy that could have been spent on campaigning is now spent on discussing
A2: I recognize that we have a problem with not enough women being in the highest positions of power. That’s why I promise that as chancellor, half of my cabinet will consist of women.
F2: A smart pivot, though you avoided addressing the allegations directly. Your base still is soothed by this promise, though some wonder how you want to achieve this when you form a coalition with the more right-wing parties that traditionally don’t have as many strong women.
A3: Annalena Baerbock and I are co-party leaders and will both play an important part in this campaign. She will be mostly responsible for our foreign policy plans, for example.
F3: Baerbock is happy to campaign with you and cooperate, and your base is happy. However, by emphasizing that you are a team so much, you make it harder to stick out as chancellor candidate.
A4: It’s important that we stay united as a party if we want to win this election. Annalena Baerbock and I agreed that I should be the candidate, but she will of course have an important post in my cabinet if she wants it.
F4: While the accusations don’t completely stop, by and large, your party agrees that winning this election is more important than squabbling. Baerbock, for her part, is happy to campaign with you.

Q8: In the past, you’ve been criticized for some rather bizarre statements you made on Twitter, like calling Bavaria a one-party state or talking about bringing democracy to Thuringia. In response, you deleted your social media presence. Do you have anything to say about this?
A1: It was a wise decision to delete my Twitter account. The platform is not good for political discourse, and the young and cool people are somewhere else anyway.
F1: Perhaps you’re right in your analysis, and there are more important demographics to win over than Twitter users - still, your refusal to use social media hurts your campaign.
A2: I admit that these statements were unfortunate - but they have been blown way out of proportion by the right-wing media. Still, I don’t think returning to Twitter is necessary to get my point across to the German people.
F2: Most people don’t like how you’re trying to paint yourself as the victim in this situation and your refusal to use social media hurts your campaign.
A3: There’s nothing wrong with preferring platforms that allow a more substantive discourse than Twitter. Besides, there are Green Party accounts for people to follow if they really want to use Twitter to stay up to date.
F3: From time to time, you get needled for refusing to use the platform, but a Green Party account that posts many of your statements and status updates helps combat the issue.

Q9: Time and time again, the Green Party has said that more needs to be done about climate change. In an interview, you are now asked what this means concretely for the price of gasoline.
A1: Unfortunately, if we want to lower our carbon emissions, the price of gasoline has to rise by about 16 cents per litre over the next five years.
F1: Environmental organisations agree, though, with gas prices at an all-time high already, this is sharply criticized by many others. The word 'unfortunately' unfortunately just isn't very popular politically.
A2: As the price of CO2 rises, so will the price of gasoline. We have to keep an eye on affordability, but a price hike is unavoidable.
F2: At least you are trying to hedge the issue and be mindful of the impacts of a higher price, though since you didn’t say a number, a lot of people assume the worst.
A3: Gas prices have to rise a lot - around 28 cents per litre over the next five years. We need to invest in public transit as well to make individual traffic less attractive overall.
F3: Everyone but the most ardent environmentalists is deeply alarmed by that statement - your opponents point out that this would make using a car unaffordable for large parts of the population. Rural voters especially seem to be sceptical towards this stance.
A4: After the price for CO2 went into effect at the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen by 6 cents per litre already - for now, this is enough.
F4: The next day, Friday For Future calls for environmentally minded people to vote for climate lists instead of the Green Party. This will probably hurt you, especially among young people. Here's hoping you can make inroads among groups that turn out more reliably

Q10: June 2021: As the election comes closer, many voters are giving you a closer look. In the last years, the Green Party has acquired the reputation of being an elitist party for educated and rich people. You’ve studied philosophy and philology, giving your opponent an opening to call you an ivory-tower intellectual. How do you want to combat this?
A1: This is more of a problem with the whole party than with me personally. I want to focus on our programs that help poor and disadvantaged people in this country to combat this image.
F1: You’re making some inroads with these groups, though Söder is winning the favourability battle for voters looking for a ‘man of the people’
A2: When I was minister in Schleswig-Holstein, I talked with everyone, even people who would never vote Green. I’ll keep that attitude for the election campaign.
F2: This is good for you, voters generally find you approachable and easy to talk to when you go out to meet them. Hopefully, you can win the favourability battle against Scholz and Söder!
A3: The Bundestag and politics as a whole have a problem with having mostly people with a university degree. We all need to come together to change this!
F3: You are not wrong, but the Green Party is seen as the most elitist by many, and you are seen as an example of this.
A4: Many people in Germany studied at university, so I don’t see how this makes me out of touch. It’s good if politicians are educated.
F4: If you’re trying to sound elitist, this is the way to go. Your core voters don’t mind this as much, but it makes it harder to make inroads, especially among less educated people.


Q11: Since 2005, long-time unemployed people in Germany get money from the state at the subsistence level, the so-called Hartz IV. However, they receive less money if they are not looking for a job. Many people are not happy with this system - what does the Green Party want to change?
A1: We need to change how benefits are calculated so that everyone is receiving at least 50€ more. Furthermore, there should be no more sanctions if someone isn’t actively looking for a job.
F1: This is somewhat on the left spectrum of the debate, though still palpable for moderates.  It also shouldn’t be a hindrance in coalition talks.
A2: The current level of Hartz IV is a disgrace. There needs to be a massive raise, by around 200€, and an end to the unnecessary and inhumane sanctions for people not searching for a job.
F2: With a proposal and rhetoric like this, you win over some Left Party voters and poorer people - though more moderate people find this too hard to stomach, and conservatives attack you for wanting unchecked government handouts.
A3: Instead of Hartz IV, there should be a higher, universal basic income for all people in Germany. While this is expensive, the savings on bureaucracy make it possible to finance this.
F3: Experts doubt your math here and call it impossible to finance. On the whole, this idea is on the fringe and not all that popular.
A4: The system needs some minor adjustments - we can look into gradually raising the amount of money paid out but have to be careful that it doesn’t become excessive.
F4: Rhetoric like this is less leftist than voters are used to from you. Some moderates like this, though people on the left and your own youth wing are less satisfied. Although this isn't entirely out of character, since it was your party who participated in the introduction of Hartz IV under Gerhard Schröder.

Q12: A policy field which has been a surprisingly big topic this election - likely due to the Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdowns - is digitalization. What plans does the Green Party have?
A1: The Grand coalition has failed Germany in this regard, as was plain to see during the lockdowns. Under a Green government, we will put a lot of resources into modernising the digital infrastructure of this country.
F1: It’s good to press the attack here - you were part of the opposition in the last decade and can credibly offer change.
A2: We have to do a lot more to make our government data transparent. Non-personal data should be made public for all citizens.
F2: People concerned about data transparency like this. The average voter doesn’t really care, though.
A3: Frankly, it’s embarrassing how much government agencies still rely on old-fashioned methods. We have to make investments here to help them build more modern, digital systems.
F3: Almost everyone agrees, but this includes your opponents; you don't differentiate yourself from the field positively or negatively.
A4: For too long, we have relied on American companies for everything related to digitalization. We need German and European solutions, to be more independent and protect our data better.
F4: Generally, voters agree, though it’s unclear how much you can actually do to change this situation.

Q13: One possible measure to reduce carbon emissions that has been suggested by your party again and again is a general speed limit on the German Autobahn. You’re asked to clarify your position in an interview.
A1: I want to reaffirm our position here -  we need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h to reduce carbon emissions. We have to hit our emission targets somehow and reducing traffic emissions is one part of that.
F1: You’ve stuck to your principles here, but this is a divisive topic. The FDP in particular attacks you sharply for it.
A2: We need a tempo limit, yes, but not just for climate reasons: A lot of accidents and deaths could be avoided if people wouldn’t be speeding excessively.
F2: While the tempo limit is still divisive, this argument is somewhat more convincing than the pure climate one to the average German.
A3: With a general tempo limit being so unpopular, that is not something we want to focus on in the next legislative session. However, we will look into introducing new tempo limits on selected highways.
F3: Your base is very deflated by this, and the SPD and Left party keep advocating for a tempo limit, making you seem spineless.
A4: Not only do we need a general tempo limit of 130 km/h on highways, but we also need one of 30 km/h within city limits - that would be a truly effective measure against climate change.
F4: A general tempo limit on highways is divisive - 30 km/h within city limits is straight-up unpopular. You’ve done yourself no favour with this position.

Q14: July 2021: There’s some trouble with your co-party leader Baerbock. In the past weeks, she has admitted to forgetting to report payments she got and having a misleading CV. Now, a book she published allegedly contains plagiarised passages. What’s your comment on this situation?
A1: The last thing I need now is Baerbock dragging me down with her scandals. For the rest of the campaign, I’ll sideline her as much as possible.
F1: Both she and your party in general are unhappy about this, especially as some see these allegations as unfair. For the next few weeks, the mood at most party meetings is very subdued.
A2: Both Baerbock herself and I admit that she made some mistakes. However, this should not distract us from the more important topics. I want to talk about policies!
F2: Since she is not the chancellor candidate, her problems never dominate the front pages for too long. They’re still an annoying distraction for your campaign, though.
A3: These allegations are unfair and part of a right-wing smear campaign against the Green Party in general. I will fight back and defend Baerbock whenever I’m asked about this.
F3: Baerbock is grateful that you’re sticking up for her, and this helps with party unity. However, this also keeps her scandals in the news cycle for longer, which isn’t helping the party’s image.
A4: The CDU/CSU was involved in a massive scandal with many of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks. Scholz of the SPD oversaw the disastrous Wirecard collapse and was involved in corrupt cum-ex banking deals. Compared to that, Baerbock’s missteps are insignificant.
F4: This leads to accusations being thrown around between all three parties, dragging down everyone’s favourability numbers. Populists on both sides of the aisle salivate at the mudslinging.

Q15: Widespread flooding is affecting large areas of western, southern and middle Germany. Other politicians, like Laschet, are travelling to the affected areas. Do you want to go there too?
A1: No, it would be improper to try to politicize this catastrophe. I’m of course making statements supporting all the emergency responders, but I won’t go there myself just to get some pictures.
F1: Some people appreciate the restraint, but you’re accused of being unapproachable by others. Söder, in contrast, gets some nice pictures of him in rubber boots and positive media attention.
A2: I will travel to some of the affected regions, yes. However, I don’t want the press to be around, I just want to talk to some affected people.
F2: This helps you a bit locally, but people elsewhere wonder where you are. Söder, in contrast, gets some nice pictures of him in rubber boots and positive media attention.
A3: Yes, I want to go there. Specifically, I want to go to some affected cities with Green Party mayors. I’ll look at the devastation and make a public statement with them.
F3: You get some positive press coverage and good pictures. Meanwhile, Söder gets some nice pictures of him in rubber boots and positive media attention.
A4: Of course, I want to travel there, talk to affected people and show myself as a man of action. I want to show that, when disaster strikes, I’m there for people.
F4: You have a good way with people and your visits go very well, allowing you to outshine even Söder, who also visited the affected areas.

Q16: After the devastating floodings, climate change is once again a much-discussed topic in the media and politics. You are expected to make a statement on this topic, did this catastrophe affect your stance?
A1: We, the Green Party, have said for decades that we need to do more against climate change to avoid catastrophes like this. That’s why we call, for example, for an end of using coal to produce electricity by 2030.
F1: Coal-producing regions aren’t happy, but this is nothing new. Other than that, this is fairly well received, and your party sees itself vindicated, though some accuse you of politicizing the situation. Söder also attacks this proposal as unrealistic.
A2: I don’t want to come across as wanting to profit from this disaster. Instead of talking about climate change, I will talk about helping the victims in the coming days.
F2: Many feel like you are leaving an opportunity on the table here, with climate change being such a big topic without you having to start the discussion. The affected people appreciate your concerns though.
A3: This catastrophe has shown that we need to do much, much more to prepare for flooding and other extreme weather events. At the same time, we need to do more to reduce our carbon emissions.
F3: While a few people accuse you of exploiting the catastrophe for political gain, many people agree with this and see you as the most credible party on climate issues at first. However, Söder somewhat steals your thunder with his climate plans.
A4: Of course, we need to do more against climate change. I’m happy that Söder is coming around, though I would like to remind people that under his government, Bavaria has barely done anything to combat climate change.
F4: This attack stings for Söder. He tries to hit back by calling your proposals unrealistic. It’s a bruising exchange, though observers agree that you have the other hand here.

Q17: It’s now less than two months until the election, and the campaign is heating up. Is there any specific region you want to focus on until election day?
A1: Our party colleagues in the Saarland had some conflict and didn’t manage to settle on a valid candidate list yet. Let’s help them sort this out.
F1: With your help, they manage to finish the list. The Saarland is quite small, but every vote potentially counts, so it’s good that you are eligible there.
A2: Winfried Kretschman, the only Green Minister-President, has just won his reelection this spring and is very popular. I want to campaign with him in Baden-Württemberg and South Germany in general.
F2: Kretschmann’s popularity is an asset in these regions. In a bad development, your state party in the Saarland screwed up their candidate list though, meaning you can’t receive any votes in that state.
A3: I’m quite content with our polling numbers in West Germany, but we are still far behind in East Germany. I want to focus on this region, both by travelling there and promising do to more to help them catch up.
F3: Let’s see if you can help your party perform better in these states than usual.  In a bad development, your state party in the Saarland screwed up their candidate list though, meaning you can’t receive any votes in that state.
A4: The states of Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have their state elections parallel to our federal elections. I want to campaign there to help our leading candidates in these elections.
F4: While these might not be the best strategy for your personal result, the two state parties appreciate your help a lot.  In a bad development, your state party in the Saarland screwed up their candidate list though, meaning you can’t receive any votes in that state.


Q18: August 2021: The Covid vaccine has become widely available to the whole population this summer. While a lot of people have gotten it already, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. What should be done about that in your opinion?
A1: It is legitimate that unvaccinated people don’t have the same rights and privileges as vaccinated people. Maybe that will help convince everyone to get vaccinated.
F1: Broadly, voters agree, though you get attacked by the FDP and elements in your own party for this. Some are worried about this leading to a two-class society.
A2: We are doing a lot to get everyone vaccinated right now without thinking about the consequences. What if the vaccine is toxic? We should try some more natural medicine instead.
F2: There is a certain, tiny element of the Green Party that likes this. The rest of your party - as well as voters in general - are wondering if you’ve lost your mind.
A3: At this point, we don’t need mandatory vaccinations yet, though it is something that is probably needed later on if the vaccination rates stay too low.
F3: Your core voter base is open to this, but compulsory vaccinations are generally unpopular right now, and this statement leaves you wide open for attacks.
A4: Overall, we are on the right path with the vaccination campaign. We need to do more to reach everyone though, including mobile vaccination teams going to areas with low vaccination rates.
F4: This is a sensible proposal that also sets you apart from the other parties.

Q19:  Throughout the campaign, Olaf Scholz and the SPD have struggled in the polls, and while some people were sceptical of you in the spring, your polling numbers are still good. What’s your strategy for the final few weeks of the campaign?
A1: Our main opponent is the CDU, so I will emphasize our moderation and commitment to lead a sensible government. Söder is an opportunist who will say what gets him elected but can’t be trusted in government.
F1: Söder is very popular, and it helps to attack him to stay in contention - opportunist or not, it isn’t easy to dent his popularity though.
A2: The SPD is down, but still the party that’s politically most similar to us, so their voters should be easiest to win over. I will make an effort to target them and get them to vote Green this election.
F2: A few voters are convinced, but mostly, the SPD is down to their loyal core voters already.
A3: It looks like the Left party might struggle to reach 5%. I’ll specifically target their voters, maybe we can keep them out of parliament and simplify finding a majority.
F3: While the amount of votes you gain this way is minimal, this might change the majority calculus after the election. Let’s see if this gambit pays off.
A4: They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. I’ll try to win over some of their voters.
F4: Your motives are admirable, but how exactly do you plan to do that? There are probably no two parties that have as little overlap as you and the AfD. Your efforts will have minimal effects at best and confuse your core base.


Q20: One topic that’s important basically every election season is tax policy. Many people wonder how you want to finance all the new spending you promise - do you want to raise taxes to achieve that?
A1: To finance necessary government spending, taxes on the rich have to be raised. We should reinstate the wealth tax and raise the income tax, but in a way that leaves small and medium-income earners unaffected.
F1: Your position is very similar to the SPD’s there. It’s broadly popular on the left spectrum, but you don’t do much to differentiate yourself.
A2: Effectively combatting climate change is our number one priority, and to finance this, taxes need to be raised across the board. The wealthy will of course have to bear the highest increase, but unfortunately, everyone will have to contribute more.
F2: With this position, you’re barely pleasing anyone. Parties on the right attack you for wanting to raise taxes so much, and parties on the left accuse you of being indifferent towards poorer people.
A3: We need to raise taxes on the rich a bit, yes. However, we also need to modify the clause in our constitution that disallows too much government borrowing. It should be possible to take out loans for investments in important projects.
F3: A lot of voters follow your logic. However, since a 2/3rds majority is needed to modify the constitution, others wonder if there is any way for you to actually achieve what you want here.
A4: Well, people are right, all the things we promised to do to combat climate change are very expensive. It’s more important to not raise taxes though, so unfortunately, we have to abandon a lot of those promises and only do what’s affordable with current state income.
F4: Your intentions to move towards the middle are good, but giving up your core promise to be the party that actually wants to invest money to do something about climate change will cost you a lot of support.

Q21: The election is in about a month now, and as usual, there will most probably be a coalition government afterwards. Which parties do you want to talk to?
A1: The party we have the most overlap with is the SPD - therefore, I want to form a government with them.
F1: Your programs share a lot of similarities, but it’s improbable that you’ll get a majority together. People also notice your silence on the Left party.
A2: I want to categorically rule out a coalition with the Left party, they are just too far from us on foreign policy. Apart from that, we’ll talk to all democratic parties.
F2: This takes away an avenue of attack against you, though you might regret it during the coalition talks.
A3: The only realistic path to a true left-wing government is with the SPD and the Left party. My favourite coalition would be with those two, I’m certain we can find compromises on contentious topics.
F3: The Left party and more leftwing voters welcome this statement, but you’ve confirmed the worst fears of many moderates. It’s also unclear what compromise you can find on foreign policy with a party that wants to exit NATO.
A4: In Schleswig Holstein, I’ve been part of a successful Jamaica coalition. I want a government that takes climate change seriously, but I have nothing against governing with those two parties.
F4: The Left party criticizes you for preferring right-wing parties to them, and some left-wing voters agree. This eases the concerns of many moderates though and blunts the impact of an anti-Red-Red-Green scare campaign.

Q22: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. The government is sharply criticised for its botched evacuation. What is your opinion on the matter?
A1: Both parties in government, the CDU/CSU and the SPD screwed up here. No matter how much they’re blaming each other, the voters will see that we need to move on from both of them.
F1: With so much mudslinging going on, voters were looking for something more positive - though the government parties still get hurt.
A2: Right now, it’s important that we don’t instrumentalize this topic for the election, but work to find concrete solutions to help the people. We called for an evacuation last month already, and we need to do something now before it’s too late.
F2: Politicians of the SPD and CDU are accusing each other of being responsible for the failure, while you manage to look pragmatic and sensible.
A3: We need to evacuate as many people from Afghanistan as possible, especially people who cooperated with our troops, journalists and women’s rights activists. They are very endangered after the Taliban takeover.
F3: It’s a good thing to advocate for taking in refugees since the type of person that considers voting for you is in favour of that. It also differentiates you from anti-refugee Söder. However, it’s unclear how you want to actually save those people.
A4: The Green Party is a party of pacifism, and we’ve been against this war in Afghanistan from the start. While the pictures are tragic and we need to do what we can to help, this whole episode shows why we shouldn’t get involved in these types of conflicts.
F4: The Green Party voted for the Afghanistan mission and was even part of the government in 2001. This statement by you is attacked as both unproductive and factually wrong.

Q23: September 2021: For the first time in German history, a Green Party candidate has been invited to the chancellor debate. In another first, the debate will be three-way, between you, Olaf Scholz of the SPD and Markus Söder of the CSU. Who do you want to focus on?
A1: It will be easier to win over SPD voters, so I will focus on attacking Scholz.
F1: Let’s see how this goes, hopefully, you can peel off some left-leaning voters.
A2: To win this election, I need to take some voters from Söder. I will focus my attacks on him.
F2: Let’s see how this goes, hopefully you can weaken his position.
A3: Actually, I don’t want to attack anyone, I want to remain positive and above the fray.
F3: Hopefully, the German people will appreciate your positive strategy.
A4: I’ve been invited to this debate, yes, but I doubt the moderators will give me a fair shake. I refuse to participate!
F4: No one understands why you refuse this historic opportunity. This makes it look to people like the chancellor race being between Scholz and Söder now.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: He’s the incumbent vice chancellor and has been a part of the Grand coalition for the last four years. People who want real change in this country have to look elsewhere!
F1: Overall, you are right, but Scholz points out that he doesn’t want to enter a new Grand coalition and his program contains many new ideas for Germany. Overall, you and Söder tie the debate.
A2: I want to hit him on his scandals, both as finance minister and earlier. He mishandled the Wirecard collapse, was involved in the cum-ex banking scandal and had a disastrous response to the G20 meeting when he was mayor of Hamburg.
F2: These are damaging attacks that really undermine his attempt to portray himself as the most competent candidate. Overall, you win the debate.
A3: He’s just not as leftwing as he pretends to be now, not on climate change, not on social security. He’s always been known as a moderate, I’ll attack him on not being serious about all the change promised in the SPD program.
F3: Ah, leftist infighting, a classic. He and you argue a lot about who has the more ambitious, yet realistic, proposals and in the end, Söder wins the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Söder is seen as the winner of the debate.

Q25: It’s the final days of the campaign now, the election will happen very soon. With whom do you want to campaign in these last few days?
A1: Luisa Neubauer, the most famous German Fridays For Future activist, is actually a member of the Green Party. I want to hold some campaign events with her.
F1: It takes a lot of convincing to get her to appear with you, but this should help energize the youth vote. Good luck tonight!
A2: Annalena Baerbock has had some issues during the campaign, but she is the co-party leader and an important figure within the party. I want to campaign with her.
F2: You energize your core voters and your party in general but don’t appeal to any specific group by campaigning with her. Good luck tonight!
A3: There will be state elections in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern parallel to the federal elections. I want to campaign with Bettina Jarasch in Berlin to help make her the second Green head of state government!
F3: While this might not be the best option for you electorally, hopefully, you can help her get over the line and finish first. Good luck tonight!
A4: Winfried Kretschmann is the only Green Minister-President and a very important figure of the moderate wing of our party. I want to campaign with him.
F4: He’s popular with both moderates and in Baden-Württemberg, so that should especially help you there. Good luck tonight!

Alternative zu Q8 falls Social Media in Frage 1
Q26: At first, your return to social media went well, but now you are criticized for a tweet in which you compare Söder to a third-world strongman. This is not the first time you’ve made a bizarre tweet - some years ago, you had implied that Bavaria is a one-party state and Thuringia is not democratic. How do you want to react?
A1: It was a mistake to return to social media - I apologize for the remark and delete my accounts, this time for good.
F1: Deleting your accounts so soon after returning makes you seem indecisive - some voters also question if you’re the right person to represent Germany if you can’t stop yourself from making these statements.
A2: First, I want to apologize to Markus Söder, I should have chosen my words better. From now on, I want my twitter account to be run by a team that double-checks my tweets.
F2: Söder accepts the apology, but this still hurts you. Let’s hope that from now on, you will be stopped before you tweet out something like this.
A3: People keep taking my words out of context - they might sound bad if you only here a half-sentence, but overall, I stand by the gist of what I said.
F3: This reaction is not seen as appropriate by most people, and CDU/CSU politicians attack you harshly over your defamatory comments in the coming days. Your party isn’t amused either and convinces you to have a team check all your tweets before you publish them.
A4: I recognize that my tweet was inappropriate and apologize for it. However, in this day and age, you need social media, and I will keep using it.
F4: While your apology is accepted, the party is not thrilled about you potentially ruining the campaign with your tweets. After some heated discussion, you agree to a team that checks all your tweets before you publish them.

Q27: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Markus Söder, Minister-President of Bavaria and chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: He’s a political opportunist whose position changes like a flag in the wind. Germany needs a chancellor with strong values, not someone like him!
F1: Söder fights back passionately against this attack, claiming his positions evolve when new information comes along. Overall, he and Scholz tie the debate.
A2: The program of his party regarding climate change is very unambitious. In the past, the CDU/CSU has not done enough to combat climate change, and while he likes to present himself as a fighter for climate change, it’s all rhetoric and no substance.
F2: He hits right back, calling your proposals unaffordable and going too far, compared to his realistic proposals. Overall, he gets the better of you and wins the debate.
A3: For the last 16 years, this country has been governed by the CDU/CSU, and they are out of ideas on what to do in government. This country needs change and Söder is not the outsider he claims to be, but a part of the establishment.
F3: A convincing argument, especially considering that many voters want change. However, Söder presents himself as more than just a continuation of the Merkel years. Overall, you and he tie the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Söder is seen as the winner of the debate.

Q28: During the Triell, you decided to focus on presenting your case to the German people without too strong attacks. What are your main points?
A1: The CDU/CSU has been in government for 16 years, the SPD for 8. This country needs change, and I’m a fresh face that can deliver it, unlike the other two candidates.
F1: Some voters prefer stability, but many want to see some change in this country. Overall, you win this debate.
A2: There is one issue that really matters in this election: Climate change! I’m the only one to have a program that’s ambitious enough to truly make a difference.
F2: While you put out a passionate plea, Scholz and especially Söder hit you hard on some of your more unpopular proposals. Overall, Söder is the winner of the debate.
A3: I’d like to focus on our social policies, like a higher minimum wage, higher taxes for the rich and a reform of the Hartz IV system.
F3: You and Scholz have similar positions here, allowing Söder to get in effective attacks and differentiate himself. Overall, Söder wins the debate.
A4: Actually, screw this! I will attack them both whenever an opportunity presents itself. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You come across as unprepared and overly aggressive. This doesn’t help you at all and overall, Söder wins the debate.
