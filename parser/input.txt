SPD-Mützenich

Q1: August 2019: It’s more than two years until the federal election. However, European elections just happened and the SPD has suffered disastrous losses. This prompted the party leader, Andrea Nahles, to resign. Now, the party members should vote for a new party leader. You’ve recently become leader of the parliamentary group which was also lead by Nahles before. What do you want to do in the leadership election?
A1: Our Party needs a stable hand to guide it through the current crisis and towards the federal election. That’s why I support Olaf Scholz, the current Vice Chancellor, in his bid for leadership.
F1: Scholz and his partner in the leadership challenge, Klara Geywitz, narrowly win the first round. However, they lose the second one. Scholz is damaged from this, but your unsuccessful support didn’t improve your standing in the party. (+0 points for nomination)
A2: The European elections were a wake-up call that we need to make some changes. That’s why I support Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans in this challenge. They can guide the party on a more leftist course while still remaining in the Grand Coalition.
F2: Perhaps due to your support, they get the most votes in the first round and win the second. Scholz’s image is damaged from losing, your star is rising, and your relationship with the new leadership starts on good footing.(+2 point or nomination)
A3: It’s clear what’s to blame for the current malaise - our decision to participate in yet another Grand Coalition. That’s why I’m backing the duo of Lauterbach und Scheer, who advocate for an end of this construct.
F3: Yery closely, Lauterbach and Scheer make it into the second round, where they end up losing against Esken and Walter-Borjans. Scholz, who didn’t even make it into the second round, is gravely embarrassed by not even making it out of round one. (+1 point)
A4: When I ascended from temporary to permanent leadership of the parliamentary group, I had almost unanimous support. That’s why I believe that I should look into running in the leadership election myself.
F4:After talking to some advisors and trying to find a suitable female partner to run with, you decide against entering into the contest after all. Esken and Walter-Borjans win in the second run, you look indecisive and weak. Some member of the parliamentary group even have second thoughts about you as leader. (-1 point)

Q2: November 2019: An agreed half-time evaluation of the Grand Coalition is coming up soon. As leader of the parliamentary group, you’re not directly involved in the evaluation process - however, your opinion is still sought and your actions here could indicate your general leadership style. How do you want to proceed?
A1: I’m not part of the government, so it’s not my job to influence this evaluation. Whatever is decided, I’ll make sure that the parliamentary group follows through with implementing it. That is my job, after all.
F1: The party appreciates you focusing on your core job. However, if you have any ambition to become chancellor candidate, you have to be more forceful. Olaf Scholz just got some good press when he presented the - positive - evaluation report.(-1 point)
A2: This Grand Coalition is not good for our party and not good for Germany. I sincerely hope that it’s not in the best interest of the party to stay part of this coalition. In general, I want to be outspoken as a more leftwing voice in the party.
F2: Despite the somewhat positive coalition evaluation, your comments lead to renewed speculation if the GroKo is going to survive. Voters don’t like this posturing by and large, though the left wing of the SPD grows more and more supportive of you. (+1 point)
A3: While we haven’t achieved everything we wanted to, many of our promises have already become laws and many more are on the way. That’s why right now - and for the rest of the legislative session - I will use my position to keep the parliamentary group in support of the government.
F3: The wing of the party that’s in favour of the Grand Coalition appreciates your support a lot. However, this establishmentarian approach means you get few headlines, and Scholz remains the face of the moderate wing despite your efforts. (+0 points)
A4: Alone, I can’t achieve much, even in this position. That’s why I want to closely coordinate with the party leadership of Esken and Walter-Borjans. As for the Grand Coalition, I’ll make it clear that I’m not a fan of it, but not pulling out is the better alternative right now.
F4: You and the party leadership harmonize well - there’s even chatter about you becoming a new Troika. Privately, Esken tells you that you’re her favourite chancellor candidate. The Grand Coalition, meanwhile, stays both in power and fairly unpopular. (+2 points)


Q3: April 2020: The vote for the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces is up soon. What is usually a routine vote has the potential for a large conflict, since several SPD politicians want that job. Who do you want to support?
A1: Johannes Kahrs. He’s a member of the moderate “Seeheimer Kreis” and backed me for leader of the parliamentary group. It’s time for me to repay this favour and support him for this position.
F1: After some back and forth, Kahrs gets the position. He’s grateful, but many in the party don’t like the way he schemed to get into this position. You’re seen as weak and letting yourself get played by him - not a good sign for your own ambitions. (0 point for nomination)
A2: Eva Högl. She’s a competent politician, and with Kahrs and Bartels both fighting for the job, I don’t want to play favourites. Let’s nominate her as a compromise candidate and make sure the other two get some other position as compensation down the line.
F2: Your party is grateful that you managed to defuse this situation somehow - however, Högl’s competence is questioned as she’s not an expert on defence policy. Also, Kahrs resigns from all positions after this, making the SPD look chaotic once again.(+1 points)
A3: Hans-Peter Bartels. He’s done a very good job in this position in the last five years and I see no reason not to renominate him - I will strongly push for him to end this debate before it really starts.
F3: Bartels is grateful, and you get some positive attention in the party for fighting for him and not letting this situation escalate. Kahrs, meanwhile, is unhappy, but there’s probably little he can do about it. (+2 point)
A4: I’m not going to weigh in on that. The contenders should sort this out among themselves and I promise to make sure that the parliamentary group is unified behind whoever is chosen.
F4: Without your intervention, the nomination process becomes very heated, with barbs being traded back and forth. Eventually, Högl is chosen as compromise candidate, Kahrs resigns from all positions, the SPD is once again seen as the party of infighting and you as the man who didn’t stop it. (-1 point)



If 2 points or fewer
Q4: July 2020: There are rumours swirling around that you are considered as chancellor candidate for the upcoming election - while most insiders believe that Scholz will be nominated, your name is also dropped quite often, with one magazin even stating that the party has decided on you. How do you want to approach this situation?
A1:This is a great opportunity. I will talk to the party leadership -  Esken and Walter-Borjans - in private, to convince them that I’m a better candidate than Scholz. From what I’ve heard, they prefer me anyway.
F1: It seems you heard wrong. While they tell you that they like you, they have already decided on Scholz as they see him as the stronger nominee. You have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.
A2: I’m not going to comment on any rumours that are circulating here. I trust the party has a plan, and whatever will happen, I accept it.
F2: When you hear that the party has chosen Scholz over you, you feel a bit of disappointment, though it’s no real surprise. You now have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.
A3: My biggest hurdle to getting the nomination is that I’m seen as too leftist to be electable. I promise to run a moderate campaign if the party chooses me. That’s the way for us to win next year.
F3: You get praises from some moderates within the party for this stance. However, Scholz is and remains the standard bearer of that wing and is chosen as the nominee over you. You have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.
A4: I have one big advantage over Scholz and that is that the left wing of the party trusts me a lot more. In the coming weeks, I will give some interviews to confirm that I’m for a more leftist course for the SPD and would run a campaign to match that if chosen as chancellor nominee.
F4: With this pitch, you’ve laid the divisions within the party open. Unfortunately for you, the support of just the left wing is not enough, and Scholz wins the nomination with a strong electability pitch. You have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.

Q5: August 2020: To the surprise of many observers, the SPD has nominated you as their chancellor nominee and done so more than a year before the election - and the SPD is not polling anywhere near close to the top. While it’s too early to start campaigning yet, what do you want to focus on in the coming months?
A1: I owe my ascension to being more willing to work with our left wing than Olaf Scholz. That’s why I want to emphasize more leftwing talking points and eventually run a campaign that is finally a true return to our roots.
F1: You energize parts of your party like they haven’t been in a while - but be mindful of both your moderate wing and potential SPD-CDU swing voters.
A2: Now that the nomination battle is over, it’s time to start running a unifying campaign. Both our more leftwing and more moderate members will get input.
F2: This strategy risks pleasing no one, but you might be the right person to pull it off. It’s true that without a unified party, teh SPD is probably doomed to fail
A3: The moderates have nothing to fear from me. I’ll make a point of working together with Vice Chancellor Scholz to show that I’m also for  a more common-sense, centrist approach,
F3: Fortunately for you, it’s not easy to be outshined by Olaf Scholz, but some in the party wonder why they nominated you over him if you’re just trying to copy him without having the same name recognition.
A4: Let’s make this campaign more about me than about the issues. I will focus on how my expertise is what’s needed to bring this country forward.
F4: There are a few problems with that strategy - as leader of the parliamentary group, you don’t have time to constantly tingle through the talk shows as you need to do parliamentary work. Also, your name recognition is not that high - many people wonder why they should vote for you, of all people.

Q6: One topic that has been part of the political discourse in the last years is the minimum wage, which was introduced in 2015. Currently, it is 9.35€, with a non-political commission deciding when it will be adjusted. Do you want to promise changes for the election?
A1: The minimum wage is not high enough for the hard-working people in this country. It has to be raised to 14€. Anything less is simply not enough to fully participate in our society.
F1: With this proposal, you are outflanking even the Left party. It helps you win over voters from them, but for most moderates, this simply goes too far.
A2: Our current minimum wage is not enough to fight poverty. That’s why we propose to raise it to 12€, which would help low-income earners significantly - this is a red line for any government I would participate in.
F2: Your position is in tune with what the party expected - it helps you rally left-wing voters, though some moderates are turned off and insisting on this might be a hurdle during coalition talks.
A3: The minimum wage commission has been doing a good job in the past, and it would not be right to say a number here just to win votes. The system is fundamentally sound, striking a balance between economic viability and providing a hard floor for wages.
F3: This is too unambitious for your party to accept, which puts a pledge to raise the minimum wage to 12€ in the program regardless of what you said. Such a high-profile disagreement between the party and its chancellor candidate isn’t good, of course.
A4: 12€ is the red line for us - but if more is possible under a left-wing government, the SPD won’t be opposed. I want to campaign on raising it to at least 12€.
F4: While your stance is appreciated on the Left, ist also leaves you very open to attacks. Over the coming weeks, the CDU does their usual fearmongering about a Red-Red-Green government and accuses you of wanting to form that.

Q7: March 2021: During the winter, the country was gripped by the Covid pandemic and strict lockdowns were mandated. Now, the country is slowly starting to open up. While you are not a member of the government, you still have the opportunity to shape the public discourse with your position.
A1: During the winter, the lockdowns were needed, and we have to be careful not to open up too quickly. Our opening strategy and vaccination campaign should make it possible for people to go to beer gardens in the summer.
F1: Most people had enough of lockdowns and like this promise - however, you’re not really differentiating yourself with an answer like this. Meanwhile, the Greens are enjoying a surge, though largely at the expense of the CDU/CSU.
A2: I want to use this as an opportunity to attack Laschet, the party leader of the CDU. His proposed “bridge lockdown” is confusing and North Rhine-Westphalia, the state governed by him, is not doing enough to slow down the spread.
F2: Many agree that he didn’t handle the pandemic in a good way in the past few weeks, so this is a good way to attack him. Meanwhile, the Greens are enjoying a surge, though largely at the expense of the CDU/CSU.
A3: One thing we are seeing here is that the federal and state governments are making lots of decisions without looping in the parliament. I advocate for more power getting returned to the parliament, so the decisions stand on firm democratic ground.
F3: Some legal experts agree that the role of the parliaments should not be undermined even in a crisis situation like this, but by and large, the public doesn’t care.
A4: One way or another, the lockdowns are going to end soon. I want to focus more on how we can help people and businesses that struggled financially due to Covid. We’ve already done a lot, but more help is needed.
F4: Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz is miffed that you tell him how to do his job, but promises to work with you on this. Overall, financial aid is quite popular, but there are concerns about how to finance even more - the government is already taking on more debt that it’s usually allowed to.

Q8: April 2021: In 2020, the financial payment provider Wirecard went bankrupt after massive fraud was discovered. Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz is accused of making grave mistakes and letting it happen under his watch - he even recently testified before a parliamentary commission. Do you want to stand by him?
A1: These allegations against Scholz are completely overblown, the other parties are trying to abuse this situation for electoral gain. I stand by Scholz and promise that he will have a place in my government if I win the election.
F1: Party unity is a good thing, and since it doesn’t look like anything against Scholz will be proven and he is popular, people like it that you want to work with him. It’s not clear if he would actually want a job in your cabinet though
A2: Yes, I support Scholz in this situation. However, I can’t make any comments yet on who will or won’t be in my cabinet. We’ll have to decide this after the election and pick the most competent options.
F2: Some sense some veiled criticism against Scholz - it’s not enough to make for a scandal or anything, but the chatter about party disunity and a rift between you and the Vice Chancellor is distracting for your campaign.
A3: There are serious questions about his integrity and competence here. We have to wait for the final report of the commission, but if he is implicated, he should face the consequences.
F3: Aligning yourself with the parties that are criticizing him does you no favours. You’ve started some ugly intra-party fighting with your comments, the thing the SPD needs the least in its current polling situation.


Q9: The CDU/CSU has selected Armin Laschet as their chancellor candidate after a bruising nomination battle. Meanwhile, the Green Party selected Annalena Baerbock in a much smoother selection. Both of them are way ahead of you in the polls - what’s your strategy regarding them?
A1: Let’s be honest, neither of them should become chancellor. Laschet simply doesn’t have the temperament to lead the country, Baerbock is too young and inexperienced. I’m a more capable leader.
F1: A lot of voters barely know you - while not everyone is too fond of the other candidates, there aren’t many people clamoring for you to win specifically. Baerbock, meanwhile, keeps surging at the expense of Laschet.
A2: This is a good opportunity to go on the attack. Specifically, I want to call out Laschet - not even his own party is fully behind him and his recent Covid strategy in North Rhine-Westphalia was embarrassing.
F2: These are some stinging attacks, Laschet’s popularity is falling down even more. Unfortunately, it’s unclear if you or the Greens benefit from it - Baerbock keeps surging at Laschet’s expense in any case right now.
A3: This is a good opportunity to go on the attack. Specifically, I want to call out Baerbock. She has never been part of the federal or even a state government before. This country needs a steady hand, not someone as unproven as her.
F3: A lot of voters want change and a breath of fresh air. You have been a parliamentarian for very long, but haven’t been part of a government either, a fact that she’s quick to point out. Overall, this attack was ineffective, and she keeps winning over Laschet voters.
A4: I want to congratulate both of them on getting nominated. I’m looking forward to a fair election campaign between the three of us!
F4: Taking the high road neither really helps nor hurts you much here. Some people make fun of you for calling this a three-way race, though this and a fair election campaign keep the extremist parties down. To close the gap, you should probably be a bit more forceful though. Baerbock, meanwhile, keeps surging  at the expense of Laschet.

Q10: A topic that comes up from time to time during this election season is the relationship with both Nato and Russia. Gerhard Schröder, former chancellor and SPD member, is criticized for his close ties to Putin. Do you have anything to say about this?
A1: All I can say is, the SPD is committed to NATO, which guarantees the security of Europe. We also want to strengthen our cooperation with other European countries in military questions, especially France.
F1: Pundits notice your silence on both Russia and the former chancellor. While your statement goes over well, even the Greens seem to move rightwards of your stance.
A2: Schröder is no active politician anymore and is free to do whatever he wants to. We are committed to a strong alliance, but we also have business interests regarding Russia - for example, the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline that will open next year and is very important for our energy supply.
F2: This is consisten with your previous stance and popular in East Germany. However, people in the West are more critical and there’s some talk about you being too Russia-friendly.
A3: The SPD has always been the party in favour of easing tensions with the East, and I’ve been consisten in advocating for this. We need to keep talking to Putin, and former chancellor Schröder could help us with his good connections.
F3: While this is not out of character for you, this statement still makes you sound very Russia-friendly. You get roundly criticized for not taking the danger Putin poses seriously, beign called a <i>Putinversteher</i>, or “Putin-understander”.
A4: Our current policy towards Russia has not been tough enough. Schröder should either cut ties with Russia or leave the SPD. Putin cannot be trusted and we should re-evalute the Nord-Stream 2 project.
F4: Some in your party are pissed off by Schröder and agree with you - but the SPD has always been historically anti-war and more in favour of dialogue with Russia and this is a big flip-flop for you personally. The state party of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - where Nord-Stream 2 ends - is openly disagreeing withyou.

Q11: May 2021: The Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. The federal government in Berlin is now working on making the law stricter. In your opinion, what should the SPD push for here?
A1: We should quickly write a new Climate Protection Act that is ambitious, yet feasible - for example, being carbon neutral by 2045 should be the goal. It’s important that we pass this law quickly, so it should be written in a way that both the SPD and CDU can support it.
F1: The new law passes without problems - the Greens are criticizing it for being too unambitious, but overall, it was good to get it through quickly.
A2: We can now quickly correct the mistakes we made when writing the original version of this law. Back then, the CDU stopped exactly the things that have to be in the law according to the court rule, like a specific emission target for 2030. I hope they’ve come to their senses.
F2: You’re putting the CDU in a difficult spot here - they can’t really challenge that what you said is true but still want to work with you and correct the law quickly. When the new version is passed, the SPD gets most of the credit.
A3: This is a great opportunity to pass a truly ambitious law that does enough to combat climate change. We need to put in the goal to become carbon neutral by 2040, now is not the time for slowing down.
F3: You get cheers from the Green Party, but the CDU refuses to consider these proposals. After much back and forth, a very watered-down version of the law is passed, making people doubt your ability to get things done.
A4: The court mandated that the law should be changed by the end of 2022. We should wait until after the election, this is a job better suited for the new government.
F4: Your refusal to change the law now mobilises people who want a government that makes a more ambitious law after the election. Unfortunately for you, most of those people vote Green.

Q12: Tax policy is an important topic in every election and this one is no exception. Broadly, parties on the right of the political spectrum have called for lower taxes across the board, while the more leftwing parties want to raise taxes on the rich. How do you want to position the SPD?
A1: There need to be some corrections with our taxation system - higher income earners need to pay more, while low income should have to pay less. We shouldn’t change anything too radical though.
F1: This is a position that is broadly acceptable to most moderates and leftists alike. It’s not particularly inspiring though and the left wing of the party hoped for more from you.
A2: The tax burden in this country is too high, it’s hurting our hard-working population. The Soli should be abolished and taxes cut a bit across the board - though e have to be mindful that we don’t endanger fiscal stability.
F2: A pivot like this isn’t good for you - while you might win over some CDU/CSU and even FDP voters, the vast majority of them don’t trust you to actually lower taxes, especially in a left-wing government. At the same time, you are attacked from your left, by people both inside and outside your party.
A3: A lot of these other programs, especially the ones from the CDU and FDP, would make the state get way less money in taxes. Since we need both investments in the future and fiscal stability, we can’t lower taxes like they promise. Instead, there needs to be a modest tax increase for high-income earners.
F3: Your analysis is correct - however, the average voter doesn’t care about fiscal stability as much and is more concerned about what the tax plans mean for them personally.
A4: We need to do a big overhaul of our taxation system so it truly benefits the people. Much higher taxes for very high-income earners, a moderate decrease for low-income earners and a wealth tax are all needed.
F4: You’ve staked out a position on the Left of the political discourse. Let’s see if the left-wing voters you win over will make it up for the frightened moderates you lose.

Q13: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with all parties unveiling plans for how to move forward with this. What is the plan of the SPD?
A1: One thing we need to focus on here is digitalization in schools. We have learned some lessons during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Every child needs access to the internet and an internet-capable device.
F1: This is a good sub-topic to focus on. Just be ready for some uncomfortable questions about why the current government hasn’t done enough to prepare schools.
A2: Access to the internet is an important right in this day and age. Every household in Germany needs access to a fast and reliable internet connection.
F2: Of course, everyone likes fast internet, for example, to play their favourite browser game New Campaign Trail (probably better to remove this joke). Rural areas especially are looking forward to better connections.
A3: The dominance of big American internet companies is not good for Germany. We need to find German and European solutions and help local online shops to compete.
F3: Many people agree with this stance - however, it’s unclear how much you can do to actually achieve this.
A4: We need to move forward with digitalization in government agencies, schools and the administration.
F4: You don’t differentiate yourself from other parties here - basically everyone is calling for a variation of this.

Q14: June 2021: As many Germans are giving you a closer looks, some of your past statements are coming under scrutiny - you are accused of both being too friendly towards Russia and too critical of Israel, especially in the right-wing media. Do you want to react to these accusations?
A1: Neither of these topics are really discussed much. I’ll just say that I’m in favour of continuing established German foreign policy without adressing these topics specifically.
F1: Good call - you don’t want to linger on unpopular statements you’ve made in the past, and there isn’t much media attention on this.
A2: I’m not going to talk about Israel, but I will clarify my stance on Russia: While I’m in favour of Nord-Stream 2, it’s unacceptable that Russi is violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity. As chancellor, I want to bring them back to the negotiation table.
F2: Overall, this is a popular position, though Baerbock attacks you for being too soft on Russia. Let’s hope the negotiations you envision will make a difference.
A3: I’m not going to talk about Russia, but I will clarify my stance on Israel. Of course, I’m in favour of Israel existing. However, they should re-open negotiations and work towards a two-state solution.
F3: You’re doing yourself no favour by focusing on Israel, especially since your stance is attacked as too critical. The heavy media controversy is hurting your campaign.
A4: I stand by what I said. Neither demonising Russia nor unquestionably supporting Israel whatever they do are right options for our foreign policy. In both cases, a more diplomatic approach and a greater focus on negotiations is needed.
F4: Foreign policy was not the most important topic this election, but you dragged it into the limelight, and not to your advantage. The Greens hit you on being too soft on the authoritarian Russian regime, the CDU on being too Israel-unfriendly. It’s hard for you to hit back on this.

Q15: Since 2005, long-time unemployed people in Germany get money from the state at the subsistence level, the so-called Hartz IV. However, they receive less money if they are not looking for a job. Many people are not happy with this system - what does the SPD want to change?
A1: Hartz IV has to be replaced by something else we call citizen money. There will be fewer sanctions for people not actively looking for work and less bureaucracy.
F1: These proposals go over well enough, many are glad the SPD is finally ready to move on from the Hartz IV system it created. However, some people don’t like the lack of concrete numbers in this proposal.
A2: The whole system needs to be reformed from the ground up. There should be no more sanctions for people not actively looking for work, at least 100€ more paid out per person per month and the bureaucracy of the system will be significantly reduced.
F2: You’re promising a lot here - perhaps even too much, as this comes under fire from the CDU and even some in your own party that helped establish the Hartz IV system.
A3: The SPD created the Hartz IV system, and while there are some parts of it that should be tweaked, we stand by it overall. There should be a one-time payment to help them get through this difficult Covid time though.
F3: It’s true that the system was created by your party, but it’s increasingly unpopular both within the party and with voters in general and a one-time payment is not the change they are looking for. Other left-wing parties win over voters looking for reform of the system now.
A4: The whole system should be abolished and replaced with a universal basic income. This would be fairer, lead to less bureaucracy and guarantee that low-income earners also benefit.
F4: Universal basic income is an interesting idea, but one that is relegated to the fringes. You pick up a few advocates from small parties, but lose a lot of mainstream voters to parties with proposals closer to the current system.

Q16: Widespread flooding is affecting large areas of western, southern and middle Germany. Other politicians, like Laschet, are travelling to the affected areas. Do you want to go there too?
A1: No, I don’t want to be seen as politicizing this catastrophe. Instead, I will call for a special session of the Bundestag so we can quickly get the people financial aid.
F1: That’s a decent strategy. You’re more credible when calling for financial aid than Laschet. Furthermore, he is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A2: Yes, I want to go specifically to areas close to my constituency and talk to some affected people. However, I don’t want to do this in front of cameras, I’m not doing this for the media attention.
F2: You’re not making national headlines, but the local people appreciate your visits. Meanwhile, Laschet is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A3: I will travel to the affected areas and promise them federal, financial help. The government will help to fix the problems that can be fixed with money.
F3: Your statement goes over very well, especially compared to the other two chancellor candidates.  Laschet is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A4: Of course, I will travel there, and show myself as a man of action, with rubber boots and shovels!
F4: You come across as awkward and stilted, though it’s not too bad - Laschet is meanwhile pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…

Q17: After the devastating floodings, climate change is once again a much-discussed topic in the media and politics. You are expected to make a statement on this topic, did this catastrophe affect your stance?
A1: There’s no doubt that man-made climate change has something to do with this catastrophe. This needs to be a motivation to do even more to combat climate change!
F1: With Baerbock struggling, many potential Green voters are looking for an alternative. You are a bit light on policy, but give them no reason not to vote for you instead of her.
A2: The flooding has shown us that we need to do more to combat climate change, yes. However, helping the affected people and getting them the financial aid they need has a higher priority now.
F2: Some advisors think you leave an opportunity on the table to win over wavering Green Party voters, but people in the flooded areas appreciate your focus.
A3: It’s clear that we need a way more ambitious climate program. A higher price for carbon and stricter emission targets should not be off the table - alongside measures to protect people from disasters like this.
F3: While you certainly win over Green voters with this stance, your core voters are more sceptical. How can they afford energy in the future and keep their industry jobs if this is your program?
A4: Laschet said that because of a day like this, you don’t change politics, and I have to agree. While we have to evaluate if there’s anything we need to do, let’s not make hasty decisions.
F4: Laschet is both your opponent and was widely criticised for his statement, so it’s unclear why you come to his defence. The Green Party has an easy time painting both of you as out of touch with the current mood.

Q18: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Some politicians are going so far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory.
A1: We need to do whatever we can to convince unvaccinated people to get the vaccine, which means ramping up incentives and the information campaign. I’m against mandatory vaccinations though.
F1: It’s unclear if such proposals will actually help the vaccination campaign, but they certainly don’t hurt.
A2: There needs to be stronger incentives to get vaccinated. I’m advocating for making Covid tests no longer free - if the unvaccinated want to go to the restaurant for example, they’ll need to pay to get tested beforehand.
F2: Some accuse you of wanting a rift in society between vaccinated and unvaccinated people - however, this is likely to be an efficient measure to help the ailing vaccination campaign.
A3: I agree, if there’s not a significant uptick in vaccinations in the coming months, we need to think about making the vaccine mandatory. It’s something to look into in the coming weeks.
F3: This is a position on the fringe and not all that popular right now.
A4: It’s a personal decision if someone wants to get vaccinated or not. We shouldn’t discriminate against people who don’t want the vaccination and don’t waste too much money on this vaccination campaign.
F4: Perhaps you can win over a few vaccine-sceptical Querdenker and AfD voters with a statement like this. The rest of the political spectrum is mostly unified in criticising you for this.

Q19: August 2021: When you were nominated as chancellor candidate almost a year ago, your campaign seemed hopeless. Now, after missteps by both of your opponents, your position in the polls has improved significantly, while both the Greens and the CDU struggle. How do you want to capitalize on this?
A1: Baerbock seems like the more vulnerable opponent, and many of her voters are looking for a centre-left alternative to her. I will present myself as a good choice and the man who can beat Laschet to them.
F1: This strategy is mostly a success - the Greens keep collapsing and you keep rising, making a chancellor Mützenich after the election a realistic prospect.
A2: It seems better to go after Laschet voters - he lost some after his flooding gaffe and this is a good opportunity to remind voters that I would be a much better chancellor than him.
F2: While some people are convinced, many CDU voters will never vote for the SPD, and you personally are not popular among them either. You pick up some and get some Green voters regardless of your strategy.
A3: There’s no need to attack either of them. I will simply keep doing what I’m doing, show myself as the calm, competent alternative, and voters will come to me.
F3: With both other chancellor candidates floundering so much, some voters flock to you. However, you are still not so well known that just sitting back is a good strategy for you.
A4: Both Laschet and Baerbock have shown their incompetence in the past weeks and frankly disqualified themselves in this race. I’ll go on the attack and call out their failings at every opportunity.
F4: Your attacks hurt, and more and more voters are seeing you as the least bad alternative. Hopefully, that's enough to propel you to victory.

Q20: The election is in about a month now, and as usual, there will most probably be a coalition government afterwards. Which parties do you want to talk to?
A1: There’s only one coalition that can both get a majority and bring true, left change to this country: A Red-Red-Green coalition with the SPD, Greens and Left Party.
F1: There are quite a few leftists hoping for this, but also moderates scared of this. It allows the CDU and FDP to run an effective fear campaign against you, too, but parts of your base are very excited.
A2: My favourite coalition would be Red-Green. If that has no majority, we’ll have to see how we can best for a government.
F2: Since it is unlikely that Red-Green will have a majority, this isn’t saying much. Laschet needles you on your silence regarding the Left party, but this keeps your options open.
A3: One thing is clear - this Grand coalition of the past eight years can’t continue. We need to find majorities beyond it.
F3: The Grand coalition is unpopular and many voters want to move on from it. Hopefully, there will actually be better alternatives after the election.
A4: While I don’t want to rule out something completely, it’s hard to see how a coalition with the Left party would work if they don’t significantly change some of their views, especially on NATO.
F4: You’re soothing the concerns of moderates and making it harder to attack you for your openness towards the Left, but some of your base is deflated. Let’s just hope you won’t need them to form a government later.

Q21: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. The government is sharply criticised for its botched evacuation. What do you want to emphasize in this situation?
A1: We didn’t achieve our goal of making Afghanistan a peaceful and stable country. Now, we need to investigate in parliament what went wrong.
F1: Since you are not a member of the government, you can’t actually do much right now, but people still expected something more concrete from a future chancellor.
A2: We can’t let people alone as we have in the past. Endangered people have to be brought to Germany or supported in countries neighbouring Afghanistan.
F2: This separates you from Laschet, who is more cautious regarding refugees. However, it’s unclear how you actually want to save these people right now and not everyone is thrilled about more refugees.
A3: The CDU has started to blame Foreign Minister Maas, even though the Ministry of Defence under CDU politician Kramp-Karrenbauer is really to blame. Voters have to see through this attempt to slander the SPD!
F3: Accusing each other back and forth benefits neither the SPD nor the CDU. You’re in government together, so voters just hear that both of you are incompetent
A4: I admit that the government has made mistakes, Foreign Minister Maas included. We shouldn’t spend time on the blame game now though and instead see how we can help people!
F4: Despite the government being led by the CDU right now, you’re the candidate that stands most strongly for a continuation of the current government. Admitting mistakes is noble, but unlikely to help you.

If Left Party is above 4.8%
Q22: September 2021: It looks close in current polls, but it seems like the Left party will enter parliament again. Do you want to campaign against them or focus on other parties on the home stretch of this campaign?
A1: I’m not going to say this publicly, but it would be better for us if they make it in - in that case, we could form a truly leftwing Red-Red-Green coalition.
F1: You keep up your strategy to focus mostly on the Greens and CDU - let’s see if that works out on election night.
A2: With them out of parliament, a Red-Green government might become a possibility and we could marginalize them long-term. Let’s focus on winning over some Left voters, especially people who are struggling financially.
F2: Many of these feel betrayed by the policies of the SPD in the last few decades, but you manage to win some of them over regardless.
A3:  With them out of parliament, a Red-Green government might become a possibility and we could marginalize them long-term. Let’s exploit that Sahra Wagenknecht, a big figure in the Left party, has railed against the woke lifestyle left to win over the kind of people she insulted from them.
F3: It’s unclear how many of those voters actually exist and if they don’t prefer the Greens over you. However, drawing attention to the infighting in the Left party hurts them in any case.

Q23:  For the first time in German history, a Green Party candidate has been invited to the chancellor debate. In another first, the debate will be three-way, between you, Olaf Scholz of the SPD and Armin Laschet of the CDU. Who do you want to focus on?
A1: Laschet seems like the more dangerous opponent, so I will focus on him.
F1: Let’s hope you can convince voters that you are better chancellor material than him.
A2: It will be easier to win over voters from Baerbock, so focusing on her is better.
F2: Let’s hope you can convince some potential Green voters to switch to you.
A3: I want to present myself as calm and composed. Let them attack me and each other, I won’t be baited.
F3: Let’s hope you don’t get overshadowed and have a good debate performance.
A4: Actually, I don’t want to give them an opportunity to attack me. I won’t participate in this Triell!
F4: What are you doing? By staying away, this makes it seem to watchers like the race for chancellor is only between Baerbock and Laschet.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided on Armin Laschet, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and chancellor candidate of the CDU. How do you want to attack him?
A1: His gaffe during the visit after the flooding and some strange statements he’s made show that he just doesn’t have the temperament to be chancellor. I’m much better suited to lead this country.
F1: It’s not clear to voters if you would actually be a much better chancellor than Laschet, though his image is further damaged. Overall, you still win the debate.
A2: The proposals of his party are just not what this country needs. Be it taxes, minimum wage or Hartz IV, the SPD has the better program for the common man.
F2: This leads to some heated exchanges, with Baerbock jumping in on your side. Laschet tries to present himself as the voice of reason, but in the end, you and Baerbock tie the debate.
A3: Laschet has no real solutions for climate change. Especially after the flooding in the summer, it’s irresponsible to do as little as he proposes.
F3: It’s not a bad avenue for attack, though Baerbock benefits more from the climate focus of the debate than you. In the end, she’s seen as the winner.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Laschet and Baerbock tie the debate.

Q25: It’s the final few days of the campaign now, with election night just around the corner. Who do you want to campaign with during these last few days?
A1: Franziska Giffey and Manuela Schwesig are trying to win the state elections for the SPD in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern respectively. I want to campaign with them to give them a boost!
F1: While this might not be the most impactful move for you, they are grateful for the help. Good luck tonight!
A2: Kevin Kühnert, former leader of our youth wing, is very popular among young and leftwing people. I want to campaign with him.
F2: Hopefully, he can help you with these demographics. Good luck tonight!
A3: I want to campaign with the leaders of our party, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. To win this, the whole SPD has to come together!
F3: While they are not the most charismatic speakers, this focus on party unity will likely help you boost turnout. Good luck tonight!
A4: Olaf Scholz is still very popular among moderate voters. I want to campaign with him to win as many of them over to my camp in the last few days.
F4: Potential CDU voters who don’t like Laschet might be won over this way. Good luck tonight!

If exactly 3 points at Q4
Q26: July 2020: There are rumours swirling around that you are considered as chancellor candidate for the upcoming election - while most insiders believe that Scholz will be nominated, your name is also dropped quite often, with one magazin even stating that the party has decided on you. How do you want to approach this situation?
A1:This is a great opportunity. I will talk to the party leadership -  Esken and Walter-Borjans - in private, to convince them that I’m a better candidate than Scholz. From what I’ve heard, they prefer me anyway.
F1: It seems you heard right. They first push for you behind closed doors, and once they have most of the party behind you, officially introduce you as candidate. Congratulations and good luck with the campaign!
A2: I’m not going to comment on any rumours that are circulating here. I trust the party has a plan, and whatever will happen, I accept it.
F2: When you hear that the party has chosen Scholz over you, you feel a bit of disappointment, though it’s no real surprise. You now have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.
A3: My biggest hurdle to getting the nomination is that I’m seen as too leftist to be electable. I promise to run a moderate campaign if the party chooses me. That’s the way for us to win next year.
F3: You get praises from some moderates within the party for this stance. However, Scholz is and remains the standard bearer of that wing and is chosen as the nominee over you. You have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.
A4: I have one big advantage over Scholz and that is that the left wing of the party trusts me a lot more. In the coming weeks, I will give some interviews to confirm that I’m for a more leftist course for the SPD and would run a campaign to match that if chosen as chancellor nominee.
F4: With this pitch, you’ve laid the divisions within the party open. Unfortunately for you, the support of just the left wing is not enough, and Scholz wins the nomination with a strong electability pitch. You have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor.

Alternative to 19 if bad polling
Q29: When you were nominated as chancellor candidate almost a year ago, your campaign seemed hopeless. Now, despite missteps by both of your opponents, you are still quite a bit behind. Do you have a strategy to turn this campaign around in the final weeks?
A1: Baerbock seems like the more vulnerable opponent, and a lot of her voters are looking to a centre-left alternative to her. I will present myself as a good choice and the man who can beat Laschet to them.
F1: This strategy is somewhat successful - the Greens lose some ground in the polls, you gain some, but many people just don’t prefer you over Baerbock despite her failings.
A2: It seems better to go after Laschet voters - he lost some after his flooding gaffe and this is a good opportunity to remind voters that I would be a much better chancellor than him.
F2: While some people are convinced, many CDU voters will never vote for the SPD. It doesn’t help that opinions if you’d actually be a better chancellor than Laschet, are quite muddled.
A3: There’s no need to attack either of them. I will simply keep doing what I’m doing, and show myself as the calm, competent alternative, and voters will come to me.
F3: Sitting back and doing nothing is not enough in this situation. Voters have their misgivings about Baerbock and Laschet, but they’re not enthusiastic about you either.
A4: Both Laschet and Baerbock have shown their incompetence in the past weeks and frankly disqualified themselves in this race. I’ll go on the attack and will call out their failings at every opportunity.
F4: Attacking them like this might be the best way for you to get some attention and make you seem like the least bad option. Hopefully, that’s enough.

If Left Party is below 4.8%
Q30: September 2021: It looks close in current polls, but it seems like the Left party will not get the 5% of the vote needed to enter parliament. They might, however, win three constituencies and due to a special rule in the law get to ignore the threshold. Is there any way you want to strategize around this?
A1: If they don’t get into parliament, Red-Green might become possible and we can marginalize the Left party long term. I’m certainly not going to help them.
F1: A prudent choice, your party agrees with this analysis. Let’s see how this turns out on election day.
A2: A true leftwing government is probably only possible with them in the Bundestag. Let’s tell our state party in Berlin to stop campaigning in some seats the Left might win, so they can get in via direct mandates.
F2: One of your direct candidates is apparently not too thrilled about this and leaks it to the press. The CDU is having a field day with this, even people within your own party condemn this, but it also leads to a surge of the Left party in the polls, largely at your expense.
A3:  A true leftwing government is probably only possible with them in the Bundestag. Let’s tell our state party in Berlin to stop campaigning in some seats the Left might win, so they can get in via direct mandates.
F3: As instructed, the Berlin state party all but stops campaigning in all districts that are winnable by the Left party. Let’s see if this pays off on election night.


Q31: During the Triell, you decided on Annalena Baerbock, party leader and chancellor candidate of the Green Party. How do you want to attack her?
A1: She’s young, inexperienced and had a slew of scandals this summer. The German people need a better leader than her.
F1: Some find these attacks effective, but others accuse you of being condescending and sexist. Overall, you and Laschet tie the debate.
A2: Her party's proposals on social issues like the minimum wage and Hartz IV sound nice, but do you trust the Greens to deliver them? Especially in a coalition with the CDU?
F2: This leads to the two of you arguing about minute differences in your plans, while Laschet gets to present himself as an alternative and voice of reason. He wins the debate.
A3: The Green Party is nothing more than a single-issue party against climate change. While it’s an important issue, there are other important topics that her party doesn’t care about enough.
F3: Baerbock responds to this by both listing her other policies and emphasizing the central importance of fighting climate change. It’s quite effective for her and she wins the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Laschet and Baerbock tie the debate.

Q32: During the Triell, you’ve decided to present yourself as calm and collected without focusing on an opponent. How do you want to do that?
A1: I’m the most qualified man for the job - I’ve been leader of the parliamentary group for two years now and have a lot of foreign policy expertise. We need an experienced chancellor.
F1: Laschet hits back by saying he’s the only one who has actually led a government, while Baerbock counters with her own foreign policy knowledge. This was not an effective strategy for you, Laschet and Baerbock tie the debate.
A2: The SPD has achieved a lot in the Grand Coalitions. Without the CDU weighing us down, we can achieve so much more! I’m the right man to actually get things done for Germany.
F2: This devolves into a back-and-forth between you and Laschet about who stopped who from achieving what in the grand coalition. Baerbock, promising true change, manages to win the debate.
A3: The Social Democrats have always been the party fighting for the common man. I’ll put my emphasis on that, to contrast both against the CDU’s business interest and the Green Party’s elitism.
F3: This goes over somewhat alright, though a lot of the working class has left your party for the populist fringes and is unlikely to be swayed by this debate. Overall, you come out on top and win the debate.
A4: Actually, screw this! I will attack them both whenever an opportunity presents itself. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You come across as unprepared and weirdly aggressive. This doesn’t help you at all and overall, Laschet and Baerbock tie the debate.


If answer 4 was chosen on both of the last questions
Q33: July 2020: It’s more than a year until the federal election, though there are talks that the SPD already wants to nominate a chancellor candidate. You and Rolf Mützenich, the leader of the parliamentary group, are the names mentioned most often. The party leadership has invited you to talk to them - how do you want to convince them that you are the right person?
A1: I see the writing on the wall -  I lost the leadership election to two politicians that are more leftwing than me. Despite some of my personal beliefs, I pledge to run a campaign according to the needs of the base - back to the roots of the Good Old SPD.
F1: The leadership seems convinced by this, though enthusiasm looks different. You are nominated as the next chancellor candidate after some discussion. Hopefully, this stance doesn’t clash with your previous image too much, and can take the wind out of the insurgent Green sails. Glück auf, Genosse!
A2: I’m the most electable candidate, without me, the situation for the SPD will be even more hopeless than it already is. If we want to have chance at leading the new government, I am the preferred candidate of German voters, no matter if I lost the leadership contest.
F2: Leadership isn’t particularly thrilled about nominating you and after your behaviour in the past months, there are just too many reasons that speak against you. In an unlikely twist, party group leader Rolf Mützenich is chosen as the chancellor candidate and you are sidelined for the rest of the campaign.
A3:  I’m the most electable candidate, without me, the situation for the SPD will be even more hopeless than it already is. If we want to have chance at leading the new government, I am the preferred candidate of German voters, no matter if I lost the leadership contest.
F3: Leadership isn’t particularly thrilled about nominating you, but the argument is persuasive. Let’s hope you can repay the trust they placed in you by having a strong showing next year, and are not relegated to the backbench like Martin Schulz. Glück auf, Genosse!
A4: It was already a mistake by the party to not choose me as leader. I’m the Vice Chancellor, I deserve this candidacy, and if they think someone else in this party can be a better chancellor candidate, they are sorely mistaken.
F4: Unfortunately for you, the party seems to want a break from the policies of the past and is not swayed by your aggressive stance. You come off as a bad looser. In an unlikely twist, party group leader Rolf Mützenich is chosen as the chancellor candidate and you are sidelined for the rest of the campaign.



Cut content for now
In the past, pensions have been a main topic of the SPD. Just this year, a new law that was passed by the Grand coalition came into effect, guaranteeing a certain level of pensions for people who have worked long and receive little in pensions. What do you want to emphasize regarding pensions?
A1: This guaranteed pension level is a great achievement of the SPD. It shows that even in a Grand coalition, we are fighting for the little guy and achieving meaningful change.
F1: The law is fairly popular and it certainly helps to talk about your achievements during the last for years. People tend to forget what you actually do as the junior partner in this coalition.
A2: Right now, the usual age for getting pensions is 67. However, due to higher life expectancy and fewer young people, we need to raise it to 68 or 69.
F2: Few proposals are as unpopular as raising the entry age for pensions. Even though some economists agree this is necessary in the long run, it’s not something you want to say before an election.
A3: Our pension system needs to be streamlined. State employees, self-employed people and other exceptions should all use the same government pension insurance as normal employees instead of the complicated system we have now.
F3: This is a proposal that a lot of people agree with, but it’s not exactly something that makes the masses enthusiastic.
A4: We have to resist any impulse to raise the entry age for pensions beyond 67, guarantee the level of pensions or even raise it. The poverty of some pensioners is also something that needs to be combatted relentlessly.
F4: You are perhaps not the right man to sell this program. Not increasing the pension age and higher pensions are popular, but it’s unclear how this can be financed - and since you’ve been a proponent of fiscal stability in the past, this makes you look indecisive.
