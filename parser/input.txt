SPD-Scholz

Q1: August 2019: It’s more than two years until the federal election. However, European elections just happened and the SPD has suffered disastrous losses. This prompted the party leader, Andrea Nahles, to resign. Now, the party members should vote for a new party leader. You have just declared your candidacy, together with Klara Geywitz. How do you want to convince the party members to vote for you?
A1: The party needs to be reinvigorated, and we need to return to our Social Democratic roots for that. We need new answers, a vision for progress and action on the issues, like climate change or the wealth gap. One can only notice how the CDU's politics lies like mildew over the republic.
F1: This surprisingly impassioned and GroKo-critically plea easily gets you into the second round. Your association with the unpopular GroKo keeps haunting you though as you narrowly lose to Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. Your course leads to tensions in the coalition, but you get to keep your job as Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister in the end.
A2: In the last few years, the party has lost the trust of many voters. We need to win it back, which means finding Social Democratic answers to the questions of our time. For this, all wings of our party need to be unified. I stand for a confident SPD that dares to do something.
F2: With an establishmentarian, but broadly agreeable take your calm and optimistic plea reaps you a narrow plurality and entry into the second round, where you unfortunately incur a decisive loss from your left against Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. You keep your job as Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister though.
A3: I’m the candidate in this election who stands for the continuation of the Grand coalition. Tthere’s a lot we have achieved together, and I believe it’s in the best interest of the SPD to keep doing what we’re doing. Agreeable Policies, good compromises and a good working relationship with the CDU/CSU is needed to bring this country forward.
F3: Enveloping yourself as the candidate of the status quo, when the party is polling at it's all-time low is not a winning strategy, despite praise from the CDU. You lose both the leadership election in the first round, which is later won by Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans and the nomination of the chancellor candidate to Rolf Mützenich.
A4: I’m the incumbent Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister of Germany - none of the other candidates has my name recognition. I won’t focus on policy specifics and trust that being the most well-known candidate will carry me to victory. I am competent, I am experienced, I can lead this party with the dignity it deserves.
F4: This attitude alone, the "Scholzomat", didn't seem to hit the mood of the party despite appealing to centrists, as you lose in the second round of the leadership contest to Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. While some call for resignation, you keep your job as Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister, but your position in the party is weakened by this affair.

Q2: November 2019: One condition the SPD had for entering the Grand coalition was that there would be an evaluation at half-time. The time for that is now - as Vice Chancellor, you have some input. Are you satisfied with what the Grand coalition has achieved so far?
A1: Overall, we are satisfied. We’ve finished about a third of the projects we wanted to do according to the coalition agreement and a lot more are currently on the way. We are on a good path.
F1: This was the expected framing from you. It helps to point to the things you have achieved but in the past, achieving things hasn’t helped the SPD electorally.
A2: We have made good progress on a lot of projects and definitively want to continue the coalition until the end of the term, yes. However, after the next election, the country needs a new government!
F2: A lot of people, especially in your party agree - this Grand coalition was already more of an emergency solution after the Jamaica coalition talks fell through. Let’s see how the majorities will be after the next election.
A3: Frankly, we can’t be satisfied with the last one and a half years. It’s simply not possible to pass what we need while governing with the CDU/CSU and I don’t know if it’s a good idea to continue this coalition.
F3: After your behaviour during the leadership challenge, this is very surprising to hear from you. The CDU/CSU accuses you of trying to drag them down, with some even calling for your resignation. In the end, the coalition survives, but with everyone’s favourability damaged.
A4: I am completely satisfied, yes. We are good governing partners and I’m looking forward to further cooperation - perhaps also after the next election.
F4: The Grand coalition is very unpopular within the party and no one - apart from you, apparently -  wants to continue it after the next election. You’ve done yourself no favour by coming out for it so strongly. In fact, you’ve damaged your image enough that the party doesn’t even consider you as chancellor candidate and nominates Rolf Mützenich.

Q3: July 2020: It’s more than a year until the federal election, though there are talks that the SPD already wants to nominate a chancellor candidate. You and Rolf Mützenich, the leader of the parliamentary group, are the names that are mentioned most often. The party leadership has invited you to talk to them - how do you want to convince them that you are the right person?
A1: I see the writing on the wall -  I lost the leadership election to two politicians that are more leftwing than me. Therefore, I’ll promise to run a more leftwing campaign when nominated as chancellor candidate.
F1: The leadership seems convinced by this - they nominate you as chancellor candidate, though they expect you to run a left-wing campaign now. Hopefully, this doesn’t clash with your previous image too much.
A2: They know who I am and what I stand for. While I recognize that the left wing of the party is a significant force, I won’t fundamentally change who I am and run a campaign that’s not too leftist.
F2: While there is some complaining, eventually, you are chosen as the nominee. Your relationship with the party leadership is somewhat damaged, but at least you are free to run a campaign that’s in tune with your persona.
A3: They know who I am and what I stand for. While I recognize that the left wing of the party is a significant force, I won’t fundamentally change who I am and run a campaign that’s not too leftist.
F3: In the end, this is just not enough for the party leadership. After much consideration, they nominate the more left-wing Mützenich, sidelining you for the election campaign.
A4: I’m the most electable candidate, without me, the situation for the SPD will be even more hopeless than it already is. If we want to have an even small chance at winning, they have to nominate me, ideology be damned.
F4: Unfortunately for you, the party doesn’t believe that you can lead them to victory either and is not swayed by this argument. Mützenich is chosen as the chancellor candidate and you are sidelined for the rest of the campaign.

Q4: August 2020: Congratulations -  despite losing the race for SPD leadership, the party has just nominated you as their chancellor candidate. The SPD is polling in third place, and while it will be a while until the campaign starts properly, few people believe you can turn it around. What will your strategy in the coming months be?
A1: I lost the leadership election because the left wing of the party was suspicious of me. In the coming months, I want to earn their trust and promise to lead the SPD on a more left-wing course.
F1: This is good for party unity, and your outreach to the left wing also improves your relationship with the party leadership. You’re not going to win over moderate voters like this though and is not consistent with how you presented yourself in the past.
A2: My biggest asset is my competent persona. I don’t want to get into policy specifics right now, instead, I want to present myself as a capable leader. Being Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister should make that easier.
F2: You are personally popular with German voters, and you are consistently ranked as a competent minister. However, your party is unfortunately still not all that popular.
A3: I’ve always been part of the party's moderate wing, and this is not something I’m going to hide. The centrist course of the SPD is correct and will lead us to victory next year.
F3: In the last few elections, the SPD chancellor candidates all came from the moderate wing of the party and all lost. The left wing was already unhappy with your nomination, and with you confirming that you want to ignore them, they are close to open revolt against you.
A4: We are far behind in the polls right now, and the only way to make up this difference is by running an aggressive campaign. I’ll attack both the CDU and the Greens.
F4: It’s not election season yet and the country is in the middle of the Covid-pandemic. Your attacks are seen as unnecessary, out of character, and do more to damage your image than drag the other parties down.

Q5: One topic that has been part of the political discourse in the last years is the minimum wage, which was introduced in 2015. Currently, it is 9.35€, with a non-political commission deciding when it will be adjusted. Do you want to promise changes for the election?
A1: The minimum wage is not high enough for the hard-working people in this country. It has to be raised to 14€. Anything less is simply not enough to fully participate in our society.
F1: With this proposal, you are outflanking even the Left party. It helps you win over voters from them, but for most moderates, this simply goes too far.
A2: Our current minimum wage is not enough. That’s why we propose to raise it to 12€, which would help low-income earners significantly.
F2: Your position is in tune with what the party expected - it helps you rally left-wing voters, though some moderates are turned off and insisting on this might be a hurdle during coalition talks.
A3: The minimum wage commission has been doing a good job in the past, and it would not be right to say a number here just to win votes. We want to keep the system as it is.
F3: This is too unambitious for your party to accept, which puts a pledge to raise the minimum wage to 12€ in the program regardless of what you said. Such a high-profile disagreement between the party and its chancellor candidate isn’t good, of course.
A4: The minimum wage has to be raised by more than the commission would. I don’t want to give a number here - the exact number depends on a lot of factors, so it’s better to decide later.
F4: Your analysis might be right, but the fact is, a specific number is just better for an election campaign. The party votes for a raise to 12€  regardless, making this moot, but your caution didn’t help you in this case.

Q6: March 2021: During the winter, the country was gripped by the Covid pandemic and strict lockdowns were mandated. Now, the country is slowly starting to open up. You can either voice your opinion on the openings or focus more on your role as Finance Minister during this time.
A1: During the winter, the lockdowns were needed, and we have to be careful not to open up to quickly. Our opening strategy and vaccination campaign should make it possible for people to go to beer gardens in the summer.
F1: Most people had enough of lockdowns and like this promise - however, you’re not really differentiating yourself with an answer like this.
A2: I want to use this as an opportunity to attack Laschet, the party leader of the CDU. His proposed “bridge lockdown” is confusing and North Rhine-Westphalia, the state governed by him, is not doing enough to slow down the spread.
F2: Many agree that he didn’t handle the pandemic in a good way in the past few weeks, so this is a good way to attack him. Söder, the other potential CDU/CSU candidate, complains about your ‘smurfy grin’ during a meeting between the federal and state governments.
A3: As Finance Minister, I have been responsible for the help our economy received during these difficult times. Now, I will call for additional financial help for people affected by the lockdowns. The culture industry - museums, theatres, cinemas and the like - especially need help.
F3: Your measures as Finance Minister have generally been popular during the crisis - it helps to remind people that you helped guide the country through this.
A4: It’s fiscally irresponsible to give out even more government aid than we already have. I’m worried about the national debt and inflation down the line - the aid we have already given out is enough.
F4: Financial aid was popular, and there aren’t many people who are worried about fiscal stability at this moment. You get attacked for this position, mainly by the Left and Green Parties.

Q7: Soon, the election campaign is going to begin properly. The CDU lost some support due to some of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks, but unfortunately, the SPD barely profited from that. In the run-up to the campaign, you’ve leaned into your moderate image - is that something you want to continue?
A1: Yes - there are many voters in the centre of the political spectrum who are looking for an alternative to the CDU. I will present myself as the option for them.
F1: You are a good fit personally for this strategy and this is consistent with your history. Let’s hope it’s what voters are looking for. Your party leaders are not thrilled about this approach, so their support is tepid.
A2: Broadly, I want to lean into my personal moderation and similar political style to Merkel. However, I will also emphasize some of the more leftist points in our program.
F2: With this strategy, you're trying to have the best of both worlds, and it’s mostly working. Voters both see you as the best successor to Merkel and hope you can deliver some of the more leftist promises.
A3: Actually, it seems that the country wants a more leftist government than we’ve had in the past decade. Therefore, I’ll abandon my moderate image and run a more leftist campaign.
F3: This is a huge turnaround for you, especially after how moderate you presented yourself in the last few months. Voters simply don’t believe that this is genuine and lose trust in you.

Q8: April 2021: In 2020, the financial payment provider Wirecard went bankrupt after massive fraud was discovered. There are allegations that a government agency that is under your responsibility as Finance Minister did a bad job and should have intervened earlier. Today, you have to talk to a parliamentary committee of inquiry about your role in this affair.
A1: I will fight back hard against the allegations today. It’s a complete fairytale that the Finance Ministry protected Wirecard. We did our job just fine, no one could have foreseen this massive fraud.
F1: Fighting back keeps voters from losing trust in you, for now. Let’s hope the committee doesn’t find anything compromising. There’s an open question about some E-Mails you sent from a private address…
A2: We need to get to the bottom of this together - I promise to fully cooperate with the committee and turn over any E-Mails I might have missed in the past. Still, I maintain that the Finance Ministry is not to blame here.
F2: Some praise you for your transparency and cooperation, let’s just hope that you didn’t make it easier for the committee to find problems with your account.
A3: Deflect as much as possible! I will give nothing but the shortest possible answers, this whole committee is a political witchhunt by the opposition anyway!
F3: Parts of the committee accuse you of obstructing their work, but overall, it doesn’t go too badly. Let’s hope they don’t find anything incriminating - there’s an open question about some E-Mails you sent from a private address…
A4: Many people had their part in this unfortunate affair, and part of the fault lies with the behaviour of the Finance Ministry. I’m sorry that this happened under my watch and promise to help investigate how it came this far.
F4: What are you doing? The committee had no proof that you were responsible - now you’ve given every ammunition to attack you. Hopefully, this will at least positively reflect in the findings of the commission.

Q9: The CDU/CSU has selected Armin Laschet as their chancellor candidate after a bruising nomination battle. Meanwhile, the Green Party selected Annalena Baerbock in a much smoother selection. Both of them are way ahead of you in the polls - what’s your strategy regarding them?
A1: Let’s be honest, neither of them should become chancellor. Laschet simply doesn’t have the temperament to lead the country, Baerbock is too young and inexperienced. I’m a more capable leader.
F1: Voters tend to agree and would vote for you if they could directly elect the chancellor. Sadly, they can’t, and many don’t seem to be convinced that voting for the SPD is the right move yet. Baerbock, meanwhile, surges at the expense of Laschet.
A2: This is a good opportunity to go on the attack. Specifically, I want to call out Laschet - not even his own party is fully behind him and his recent Covid strategy in North Rhine-Westphalia was embarrassing.
F2: These are some stinging attacks, Laschet’s popularity is falling down even more. Unfortunately, it’s unclear if you or the Greens benefit from it - Baerbock is surging at Laschet’s expense in any case right now.
A3: This is a good opportunity to go on the attack. Specifically, I want to call out Baerbock. She has never been part of the federal or even a state government before. This country needs a steady hand, not someone as unproven as her.
F3: A lot of voters want change and a breath of fresh air. Others like stability though and are convinced by this - hopefully, you are their second choice behind Baerbock. Despite your attacks, she keeps winning over Laschet voters.
A4: I want to congratulate both of them on getting nominated. I’m looking forward to a fair election campaign between the three of us!
F4: Taking the high road neither really helps nor hurts you much here. Some people make fun of you for calling this a three-way race, but you have enough time to prove them wrong. To close the gap, you should probably be a bit more forceful though. Baerbock, meanwhile, surges at the expense of Laschet.

Q10: A topic that comes up from time to time during this election season is the relationship with both Nato and Russia. Gerhard Schröder, former chancellor and SPD member, is criticized for his close ties to Putin. Do you have anything to say about this?
A1: The SPD is committed to NATO, which guarantees the security of Europe. We also want to strengthen our cooperation with other European countries in military questions, especially France.
F1: Pundits notice your silence on both Russia and the former chancellor. While your statement goes over well, the SPD is once again called a party of “Putin understanders”.
A2: Schröder is no active politician anymore and is free to do whatever he wants to. We also have business interests regarding Russia - for example, the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline that will open next year and is very important for our energy supply.
F2: Your East German state parties like this stance, though for some others, this is too friendly towards Russia.
A3: The SPD has always been the party in favour of easing tensions with the East. We need to keep talking to Putin, and former chancellor Schröder could help us with his good connections.
F3: While not entirely out of character for someone from the SPD, this statement still makes you sound very Russia-friendly. You get roundly criticized for not taking the danger Putin poses seriously.
A4: Our current policy towards Russia has not been tough enough. Schröder should either cut ties with Russia or leave the SPD. Putin cannot be trusted and we should only open Nord-Stream 2 if we get concessions from him.
F4: Your party isn’t thrilled by this, the SPD has always been more in favour of dialogue with Russia. The state party of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - where Nord-Stream 2 ends - is openly distancing itself from you.

Q11: May 2021: The Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. The federal government in Berlin is now working on making the law stricter. As Vice Chancellor, you can contribute to the new law.
A1: We should quickly write a new Climate Protection Act that is ambitious, yet feasible - for example, being carbon neutral by 2045 should be the goal. It’s important that we pass this law quickly, so it should be written in a way that both the SPD and CDU can support it.
F1: The new law passes without problems - the Greens are criticizing it for being too unambitious, but overall, it was good to get it through quickly.
A2: We can now quickly correct the mistakes we made when writing the original version of this law. The CDU has stopped exactly the things the constitutional court ruled unlawful, I hope they will be more sensible this time.
F2: You’re putting the CDU in a difficult spot here - they can’t really challenge that what you said is true but still want to work with you and correct the law quickly. When the new version is passed, the SPD gets most of the credit.
A3: This is a great opportunity to pass a truly ambitious law that does enough to combat climate change. We need to put in the goal to become carbon neutral by 2040, now is not the time for slowing down.
F3: You get cheers from the Green Party, but the CDU refuses to consider these proposals. After much back and forth, a very watered-down version of the law is passed, making people doubt your ability to get things done.
A4: The court mandated that the law should be changed by the end of 2022. We should wait until after the election, this is a job better suited for the new government.
F4: Your refusal to change the law now mobilises people who want a government that makes a more ambitious law after the election. Unfortunately for you, most of those people vote Green.

Q12: Tax policy is an important topic in every election and this one is no exception. Broadly, parties on the right of the political spectrum have called for lower taxes across the board, while the more leftwing parties want to raise taxes on the rich. How do you want to position the SPD?
A1: There need to be some corrections with our taxation system - higher income earners need to pay more, while low income should have to pay less. We shouldn’t change anything too radical though.
F1: This is a position that is broadly acceptable to most moderates and leftists alike. It’s not particularly inspiring though.
A2: Some minor adjustments are needed, but we don’t want to rock the boat here. Overall, taxes for the rich will be raised a bit to finance additional investments and some systems like the Soli should be reworked.
F2: With a program that shows so little ambition, you get attacked by the more leftwing parties and parts of the SPD itself. Perhaps moderates can make up for this though?
A3: A lot of these other programs, especially the ones from the CDU and FDP, would make the state get way less money in taxes. Since we need both investments in the future and fiscal stability, we can’t lower taxes like they promise. Instead, there needs to be a modest tax increase for high-income earners.
F3: Your analysis is correct - however, the average voter doesn’t care about fiscal stability as much and is more concerned what the tax plans mean for them personally.
A4: We need to do a big overhaul of our taxation system so it truly benefits the people. Much higher taxes for very high-income earners, a moderate decrease for low-income earners and a wealth tax are all needed.
F4: You’ve staked out a position on the Left of the political discourse. Let’s see if the left-wing voters you win over will make it up for the frightened moderates you lose.

Q13: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with all parties unveiling plans for how to move forward with this. What is the plan of the SPD?
A1: One thing we need to focus on here is digitalization in schools. We have learned some lessons during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Every child needs access to the internet and an internet-capable device.
F1: This is a good sub-topic to focus on. Just be ready for some uncomfortable questions about why the current government hasn’t done enough to prepare schools.
A2: Access to the internet is an important right in this day and age. Every household in Germany needs access to a fast and reliable internet connection.
F2: Of course, everyone likes fast internet, for example, to play their favourite browser game New Campaign Trail (probably better to remove this joke). Rural areas especially are looking forward to better connections.
A3: The dominance of big American internet companies is not good for Germany. We need to find German and European solutions and help local online shops to compete.
F3: Many people agree with this stance - however, it’s unclear how much you can do to actually achieve this.
A4: We need to move forward with digitalization in government agencies, schools and the administration.
F4: You don’t differentiate yourself from other parties here - basically everyone is calling for a variation of this.

Q14: June 2021: The parliamentary commission investigating Wirecard has finished its job and created a report. In it, you are not directly implicated, and how much you are blamed depends mostly on the party of the person asked. During the debate about this in the Bundestag, how do you want to present yourself?
A1: All this will blow over in a couple of days. I’ll let them criticize me, let other members of my party defend me and just wait this out.
F1: With how hard it is to pin the blame for this on you and how obviously partisan the attacks are, this works. The Wirecard affair remains a bit of a sore spot during the campaign, though. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.
A2: It’s obvious that these attacks on me are nothing but a cheap political ploy. There’s no clear evidence of any wrongdoing by me and I will fight back passionately against these allegations!
F2: Fighting back passionately like this just doesn’t fit with your style. It helps to defend yourself, but you come across as awkward when you try to be fiery. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.
A3: It’s obvious someone has to resign over this, and it won’t be me. Jörg Kukies, the State Secretary serving under me in the Finance Ministry will be fired over this.
F3: Many are struggling to understand this move - he was a close advisor to you, and by firing him you only seem to admit that your ministry did something wrong. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.

Q15: Since 2005, long-time unemployed people in Germany get money from the state at the subsistence level, the so-called Hartz IV. However, they receive less money if they are not looking for a job. Many people are not happy with this system - what does the SPD want to change?
A1: Hartz IV has to be replaced by something else we call citizen money. There will be fewer sanctions for people not actively looking for work and less bureaucracy.
F1: These proposals go over well enough, many are glad the the SPD is finally redy to move on from the Hartz IV system it created. However, some people don’t like the lack of concrete numbers in this proposal.
A2: The whole system needs to be reformed from the ground up. There should be no more sanctions for people not actively looking for work, at least 100€ more paid out per person per month and the burocracy of the system will be significantly reduced.
F2: You’re promising a lot here - perhaps even too much, as this comes under fire from the CDU and even some in your own party that helped establish the Hartz IV system.
A3: The SPD created the Hartz IV system, and while there are some parts of it that should be tweaked, we stand by it overall.
F3: It’s true that the system was created by your party, but it’s increasingly unpopular both within the party and with voters in general. Other left-wing parties win over voters looking for reform of the system now.
A4: People receiving Hartz IV have struggled a lot during the Covid pandemic. That’s why we’re in favour of a larger one-time payment for them to help them get by in these difficult times.
F4: Of course, people like receiving money, but it’s both a bit late for that now and they would have preferred to hear about your general plans for the system.

Q16: Widespread flooding is affecting large areas of western, southern and middle Germany. Other politicians, like Laschet, are travelling to the affected areas. Do you want to go there too?
A1: No, I don’t want to be seen as politicizing this catastrophe. Instead, I want to focus on my role as Finance Minister and promise quick, unbureaucratic financial aid to the affected regions.
F1: That’s a decent strategy. You’re more credible when calling for financial aid than Laschet. Furthermore, he is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A2: Yes, I want to go there, and talk to some affected people. However, I don’t want to do this in front of cameras, I’m not doing this for the media attention.
F2: Since you are the Vice Chancellor, many people expected to see and hear more of you, though the local people appreciate your visits. Meanwhile, Laschet is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A3: I will travel to the affected areas and promise them federal, financial help. The government will help to fix the problems that can be fixed with money.
F3: Your statement goes over very well, especially compared to the other two chancellor candidates.  Laschet is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…
A4: Of course, I will travel there, and show myself as a man of action, with rubber boots and shovels!
F4: Some mock your pictures and accuse you of doing this for publicity, while others are more appreciative. Meanwhile, Laschet is pictured laughing while visiting the affected areas and Baerbock, still reeling from a plagiarism scandal, is nowhere to be seen. Many voters are starting to give you a second look…

Q17: After the devastating floodings, climate change is once again a much-discussed topic in the media and politics. You are expected to make a statement on this topic, did this catastrophe affect your stance?
A1: There’s no doubt that man-made climate change has something to do with this catastrophe. This needs to be a motivation to do even more to combat climate change!
F1: With Baerbock struggling, many potential Green voters are looking for an alternative. You are a bit light on policy, but give them no reason not to vote for you instead of her.
A2: The flooding has shown us that we need to do more to combat climate change, yes. However, helping the affected people and getting them the financial aid they need has a higher priority now.
F2: Some advisors think you leave an opportunity on the table to win over wavering Green Party voters, but people in the flooded areas appreciate your focus.
A3: It’s clear that we need a way more ambitious climate program. A higher price for carbon and stricter emission targets should not be off the table - alongside measures to protect people from disasters like this.
F3: While you certainly win over Green voters with this stance, your core voters are more sceptical. How can they afford energy in the future and keep their industry jobs if this is your program?
A4: Laschet said that because of a day like this, you don’t change politics, and I have to agree. While we have to evaluate if there’s anything we need to do, let’s not make hasty decisions.
F4: Laschet is both your opponent and was widely criticised for his statement, so it’s unclear why you come to his defence. The Green Party has an easy time painting both of you as out of touch with the current mood.

Q18: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Some politicians are going so far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory.
A1: We need to do whatever we can to convince unvaccinated people to get the vaccine, even if that means offering a Bratwurst as a bonus when you get vaccinated. I’m against mandatory vaccinations though.
F1: It’s unclear if such proposals will actually help the vaccination campaign, but they certainly don’t hurt.
A2: There needs to be stronger incentives to get vaccinated. I’m advocating for making Covid tests no longer free - if the unvaccinated want to go to the restaurant for example, they’ll need to pay to get tested beforehand.
F2: Some accuse you of wanting a rift in society between vaccinated and unvaccinated people - however, this is likely to be an efficient measure to help the ailing vaccination campaign.
A3: I agree, if there’s not a significant uptick in vaccinations in the coming months, we need to think about making the mandatory. It’s something to look into in the coming weeks.
F3: This is a position on the fringe and not all that popular right now.
A4: It’s a personal decision if someone wants to get vaccinated or not. We shouldn’t discriminate against people who don’t want the vaccination and don’t waste too much money on this vaccination campaign.
F4: Perhaps you can win over a few vaccine-sceptical Querdenker and AfD voters with a statement like this. The rest of the political spectrum is mostly unified in criticising you for this.

Q19: August 2021: When you were nominated as chancellor candidate almost a year ago, your campaign seemed hopeless. Now, after missteps by both of your opponents, your position in the polls has improved significantly, while both the Greens and the CDU struggle. How do you want to capitalize on this?
A1: Baerbock seems like the more vulnerable opponent, and a lot of her voters are looking to a centre-left alternative to her. I will present myself as a good choice and the man who can beat Laschet to them.
F1: This strategy is a success - the Greens keep collapsing and you keep rising, making a chancellor Scholz after the election a realistic prospect.
A2: It seems better to go after Laschet voters - he lost some after his flooding gaffe and this is a good opportunity to remind voters that I would be a much better chancellor than him.
F2: While some people are convinced, many CDU voters will never vote for the SPD. You pick up some and get some Green voters regardless of your strategy.
A3: There’s no need to attack either of them. I will simply keep doing what I’m doing, show myself as the calm, competent alternative, and voters will come to me.
F3: With both other chancellor candidates floundering so much, there’s not much more you have to do than wait and let more and more voters flock to you.
A4: Both Laschet and Baerbock have shown there incompetence in the past weeks and frankly disqualiefied themselves in this race. I’ll go on the attack and will call out their failings at every opportunity.
F4: Attacking them like this goes against your calm nature and does probably more to damage your image than theirs. Still, your position continues to improve somewhat.

Q20: The election is in about a month now, and as usual, there will most probably be a coalition government afterwards. Which parties do you want to talk to?
A1: There’s only one coalition that can both get a majority and bring true, left change to this country: A Red-Red-Green coalition with the SPD, Greens and Left party.
F1: There are quite a few leftist hoping for this, but probably more moderates scared of this. It allows the CDU and FDP to run an effective fear campaign against you, too.
A2: My favourite coalition would be Red-Green. If that has no majority, we’ll have to see how we can best for a government.
F2: Since it is unlikely that Red-Green will have a majority, this isn’t saying much. Laschet needles you on your silence regarding the Left party, but this keeps your options open.
A3: One thing is clear - this Grand coalition of the past eight years can’t continue. We need to find majorities beyond it.
F3: The Grand coalition is unpopular and many voters want to move on from it. Hopefully, there will actually be better alternatives after the election.
A4: While I don’t want to rule out something completely, it’s hard to see how a coalition with the Left party would work if they don’t significantly change some of their views, especially on NATO.
F4: You’re soothing the concerns of moderates and make it harder to attack you for your openness towards the Left. Let’s just hope you won’t need them to form a government later.

Q21: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. The government is sharply criticised for its botched evacuation. What do you want to emphasize in this situation?
A1: The situation in Afghanistan right now is depressing, much that we fought for is being destroyed. We need to assess how it could come this far.
F1: Showing compassions is good, but people blame your government specifically and would have liked to hear something more concrete.
A2: We can’t let people alone as we have in the past. Endangered people have to be brought to Germany or supported in countries neighbouring Afghanistan.
F2: This separates you from Laschet, who is more cautious regarding refugees. However, it’s unclear how you actually want to save these people right now and not everyon is thrilled about more refugees.
A3: The CDU has started to blame Foreign Minister Maas, even though the Ministry of Defence under CDU politician Kramp-Karrenbauer is really to blame. Voters have to see through this attempt to slander the SPD!
F3: Accusing each other back and forth benefits neither the SPD nor the CDU. You’re in government together, so voters just hear that both of you are incompetent
A4: I admit that the government has made mistakes, Foreign Minister Maas included. We shouldn’t spend time on the blame game now though and instead see how we can help people!
F4: Despite the government being lead by the CDU right now, you’re the candidate that stand most strongly for a continuation of the current government. Admitting mistakes is noble, but unlikely to help you.

Q22: September 2021: Both the Finance Ministry led by you and the Justice Ministry let by a party colleague have just been searched by the police. The search was due to investigations into these agencies helping cover up money laundering. You’ve promptly been criticised for not having your own ministry in order.
A1: The public attorneys could have just sent a written request for information. This search was unnecessary and excessive.
F1: Probably, this will hurt you a bit regardless, but the whole thing isn’t directly related to you, and your statement doesn’t keep this in the news much longer.
A2: I refuse to comment on this. The police search wasn’t related to any of my actions and I don’t want to give this story any oxygen.
F2: Despite your refusal to talk about it, the story is still in the news for several days. Your silence doesn’t put you in a good light.
A3: This is all part of a political witchhunt! First the Wirecard investigation, now this, someone is trying to keep me from becoming chancellor!
F3: A very unusual outburst from you. Connecting this to Wirecard hurts you and it’s unclear who you are even accusing right now. This doesn’t go over well with voters at all.
A4: The problems with the specific part of the ministry that’s being investigated already started when it was still led by the CDU. I don’t have a part in this, it’s not my fault this happened.
F4: While you are technically correct, this still sounds like an attempt to shift the blame to voters.

Q23:  For the first time in German history, a Green Party candidate has been invited to the chancellor debate. In another first, the debate will be three-way, between you, Olaf Scholz of the SPD and Armin Laschet of the CDU. Who do you want to focus on?
A1: Laschet seems like the more dangerous opponent, so I will focus on him.
F1: Let’s hope you can convince voters that you are better chancellor material than him.
A2: It will be easier to win over voters from Baerbock, so focusing on her is better.
F2: Let’s hope you can convince some potential Green voters to switch to you.
A3: I want to present myself as calm and composed. Let them attack me and each other, I won’t be baited.
F3: This fits with your persona - let’s hope it’s a good strategy for this debate.
A4: Actually, I don’t want to give them an opportunity to attack me. I won’t participate in this Triell!
F4: What are you doing? By staying away, this makes it seem to watchers like the race for chancellor is only between Baerbock and Laschet.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided on Armin Laschet, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and chancellor candidate of the CDU. How do you want to attack him?
A1: His gaffe during the visit after the flooding and some strange statements he’s made show that he just doesn’t have the temperament to be chancellor. I’m much better suited to lead this country.
F1: You definitely are seen as the better potential chancellor than him by most voters, though some would have liked you to talk more about policy. Overall, you still win the debate.
A2: The proposals of his party are just not what this country needs. Be it taxes, minimum wage or Hartz IV, the SPD has the better program for the common man.
F2: This leads to some heated exchanges, with Baerbock jumping in on your side. Laschet tries to present himself as the voice of reason, but in the end, you and Baerbock tie the debate.
A3: Laschet has no real solutions for climate change. Especially after the flooding in the summer, it’s irresponsible to do as little as he proposes.
F3: It’s not a bad avenue for attack, though Baerbock benefits more from the climate focus of the debate than you. In the end, she’s seen as the winner.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: While you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this calm demeanour is second nature to you. You manage to win the debate.

Q25: It’s the final few days of the campaign now, with election night just around the corner. Who do you want to campaign with during these last few days?
A1: Franziska Giffey and Manuela Schwesig are trying to win the state elections for the SPD in Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern respectively. I want to campaign with them to give them a boost!
F1: While this might not be the most impactful move for you, they are grateful for the help. Good luck tonight!
A2: Kevin Kühnert, former leader of our youth wing, is very popular among young and leftwing people. I want to campaign with him.
F2: Hopefully, he can help you with these demographics. Good luck tonight!
A3: I want to campaign with the leaders of our party, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans. To win this, the whole SPD has to come together!
F3: While they are not the most charismatic speakers, this focus on party unity will likely help you boost turnout. Good luck tonight!
A4: It’s a bit unconventional, but despite being from a different party, I share many similarities with the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel. She won’t campaign for me, but let’s try to get to appear her at an event with me.
F4: Observers have noticed similarities between you in the past, but Merkel is still a loyal CDU woman and would rather campaign with Laschet than meet with you. Still, good luck tonight!

Q26: November 2020: One condition the SPD had for entering the Grand coalition was that there would be an evaluation at half-time. Since even you are expressing a desire for more left-wing policies, there are some speculations that the Grand coalition might not survive. As Vice Chancellor, you can help shape this report - what do you want to put in?
A1: Despite some misgivings, we can be satisfied overall. We’ve finished about a third of the projects we wanted to do according to the coalition agreement and a lot more are currently on the way. We are on a good path.
F1: The coalition holds, your reassurance helps with stability. However, after the way you ran the leadership campaign, this is seen as a flip-flop by you.
A2: We have made progress on a lot of projects and want to continue the coalition until the end of the term, it would be irresponsible to let the government collapse now. However, after the next election, the country needs a new government!
F2: Pundits notice your focus on stability. In the end, everyone agrees that it’s better to not let the government collapse, though there’s little appetite to continue this coalition longer than at all necessary.
A3: Frankly, we can’t be satisfied with the last one and a half years. It’s simply not possible to pass what we need while governing with the CDU/CSU and I don’t know if it’s a good idea to continue this coalition.
F3: Some had feared this after your tack to the left during the leadership challenge. For a few days, it looks like the coalition is over, with CDU and SPD accusing each other of being responsible. In the end, a cabinet reshuffle and some extra agreements save the coalition, though the whole affair was not popular with most voters.
A4: I am almost completely satisfied, yes. We are good governing partners and I’m looking forward to further cooperation - perhaps also after the next election.
F4: It’s unclear what to make of this - is this a ploy to save the coalition or are you really this much of a flip-flopper? In any case, the government holds, but your standing in the party does not improve. In fact, you’ve damaged your image enough that the party doesn’t even consider you as a chancellor candidate and nominates Rolf Mützenich.

Alternative to 7 if between left and moderate
Q27: Soon, the election campaign is going to begin properly. The CDU lost some support due to some of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks, but unfortunately, the SPD barely profited from that. In the run-up to the campaign, you’ve vacillated between leaning into your moderate image and appealing to the left wing. What’s your strategy for the campaign?
A1: I needed to triangulate to become chancellor candidate - now that the campaign is starting, I’ll fully return to my image as moderate
F1: You are a good fit personally for this strategy, but voters notice some back-and-forth in your rhetoric in the last year. Hopefully, they’ll still trust you as the moderate alternative!
A2: This was deliberate, and I want to continue this strategy. Broadly, I want to lean into my personal moderation and similar political style to Merkel. However, I will also emphasize some of the more leftist points in our program.
F2: Voters like consistency, so your back-and-forth in the last year is not appreciated by them. However, this strategy itself is sound, let’s hope it works out!
A3: I’ve leaned into it a bit before, but now it’s time to fully move to the left. I will abandon my moderate image fully to run a leftist campaign.
F3: This is quite a big turnaround for you, however, there it doesn’t come as a total surprise after your behaviour in the last year. Still, voters are apprehensive if you’re actually serious about this.

Alternative to 7 if left
Q28: Soon, the election campaign is going to begin properly. The CDU lost some support due to some of their MPs selling overpriced medical masks, but unfortunately, the SPD barely profited from that. In the runup to the campaign, you’ve been surprisingly leftist with your rhetoric - is this something you want to keep up?
A1: That was something I had to do to win the candidacy - now, I want to return to my previous image of a sensible moderate.
F1: While this is fitting with your general image, this clashes with your rhetoric in the past year. Voters and the party are confused by your behaviour.
A2: Partly, I want to keep this up, by leaning into our more leftist policy proposals. However, I also want to emphasize my personal moderate style and cast myself as a politician similar to Merkel.
F2: The strategy you employ here is decent - it’s not clear if voters still see you as similar to Merkel after your leftist turn in the last year.
A3: Of course! Time and time again, more moderate SPD candidates have lost against Merkel. To win, I want to present myself as the true, leftwing alternative for this country!
F3: There was some chatter if this “New Scholz” would stay around for the general election campaign, and it seems like he does! Voters aren’t entirely surprised by this after the last year, but this leftist turn is still not entirely consistent with your image. Still, the party, especially the leaders, like this and offer you additional support for the campaign.

Alternative zu Q14 falls Emails übergeben
Q29: June 2021: The parliamentary commission investigating Wirecard has finished its job and created a report. You didn’t get clearly implicated, but with the help of the E-Mails you turned over, it’s undeniable that you and your ministry made mistakes. During the debate about this in the Bundestag, how do you want to present yourself?
A1: All this will blow over in a couple of days. I’ll let them criticize me, let other members of my party defend me and just wait this out.
F1: This is simply not enough - not defending yourself makes yourself seem passive and calls for your resignation grow louder and louder. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.
A2: It’s obvious that these attacks on me are nothing but a cheap political ploy. There’s no clear evidence of any wrongdoing by me and I will fight back passionately against these allegations!
F2: Fighting back passionately like this just doesn’t fit with your style. However, it’s still better than being passive, and you manage you turn this into more of a partisan issue. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.
A3: It’s obvious someone has to resign over this, and it won’t be me. Jörg Kukies, the State Secretary serving under me in the Finance Ministry will be fired over this.
F3: It’s painful for you to let him go, but pinning the blame on him somewhat silences the voices calling for your resignation. At least you’re not the only one struggling right now - Baerbock is losing a lot of popularity due to a scandal surrounding her CV and some payments.


Alternative to 19 if bad polling
Q30: When you were nominated as chancellor candidate almost a year ago, your campaign seemed hopeless. Now, despite missteps by both of your opponents, you are still quite a bit behind. Do you have a strategy to turn this campaign around in the final weeks?
A1: Baerbock seems like the more vulnerable opponent, and a lot of her voters are looking to a centre-left alternative to her. I will present myself as a good choice and the man who can beat Laschet to them.
F1: This strategy is somewhat successful - the Greens lose some ground in the polls, you gain some, but many people just don’t prefer you over Baerbock despite her failings.
A2: It seems better to go after Laschet voters - he lost some after his floofing gaffe and this is a good opportunity to remind voters that I would be a much better chancellor than him.
F2: While some people are convinced, many CDU voters will never vote for the SPD. It doesn’t help that opinions, if you’d actually be a better chancellor than Laschet, are quite muddled.
A3: There’s no need to attack either of them. I will simply keep doing what I’m doing, and show myself as the calm, competent alternative, and voters will come to me.
F3: Sitting back and doing nothing is not enough in this situation. Voters have their misgivings about Baerbock and Laschet, but they’re not enthusiastic about you either.
A4: Both Laschet and Baerbock have shown their incompetence in the past weeks and frankly disqualified themselves in this race. I’ll go on the attack and will call out their failings at every opportunity.
F4: Attacking them like this goes against your calm nature and does probably more to damage your image than theirs. Your position in the polls won’t improve if you keep this up.

Q31: During the Triell, you decided on Annalena Baerbock, party leader and chancellor candidate of the Green Party. How do you want to attack her?
A1: She’s young, inexperienced and had a slew of scandals this summer. The German people need a better leader than her.
F1: Some find these attacks effective, but others accuse you of being condescending and sexist. Overall, you and Laschet tie the debate.
A2: Her party's proposals on social issues like the minimum wage and Hartz IV sound nice, but do you trust the Greens to deliver them? Especially in a coalition with the CDU?
F2: This leads to the two of you arguing about minute differences in your plans, while Laschet gets to present himself as an alternative and voice of reason. He wins the debate.
A3: The Green Party is nothing more than a single-issue party against climate change. While it’s an important issue, there are other important topics that her party doesn’t care about enough.
F3: Baerbock responds to this by both listing her other policies and emphasizing the central importance of fighting climate change. It’s quite effective for her and she wins the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: While you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this calm demeanour is second nature to you. You manage to win the debate.

Q32: During the Triell, you’ve decided to present yourself as calm and collected without focusing on an opponent. How do you want to do that?
A1: I’m going to explicitly present myself as the natural continuation of the Merkel years. While we are from different parties, we are both moderate and known for our calmness.
F1: A lot of people want something new, but many are also looking for stability. Baerbock presents herself as the fresher alternative, but Laschet is unable to counter. Overall, you and Baerbock tie the debate.
A2: Leaning into my persona will be enough. I’ll just answer all of the questions in a calm way, won’t let myself get baited into heated exchanges and subtly emphasise my experience.
F2: For some reason, voters in Germany really like this style of politics. It’s enough to carry you to victory.
A3: The Social Democrats have always been the party fighting for the common man. I’ll put my emphasis on that, to contrast both against the CDU’s business interest and the Green Party’s elitism.
F3: This goes over somewhat alright, though a lot of the working class has left your party for the populist fringes and is unlikely to be swayed by this debate. Overall, it’s a tie between you and Laschet.
A4: Actually, screw this! I will attack them both whenever an opportunity presents itself. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You come across as unprepared and weirdly aggressive compared to your usual demeanour. This doesn’t help you at all and overall, Laschet and Baerbock tie the debate.


Cut content for now
In the past, pensions have been a main topic of the SPD. Just this year, a new law that was passed by the Grand coalition came into effect, guaranteeing a certain level of pensions for people who have worked long and receive little in pensions. What do you want to emphasize regarding pensions?
A1: This guaranteed pension level is a great achievement of the SPD. It shows that even in a Grand coalition, we are fighting for the little guy and achieving meaningful change.
F1: The law is fairly popular and it certainly helps to talk about your achievements during the last for years. People tend to forget what you actually do as the junior partner in this coalition.
A2: Right now, the usual age for getting pensions is 67. However, due to higher life expectancy and fewer young people, we need to raise it to 68 or 69.
F2: Few proposals are as unpopular as raising the entry age for pensions. Even though some economists agree this is necessary in the long run, it’s not something you want to say before an election.
A3: Our pension system needs to be streamlined. State employees, self-employed people and other exceptions should all use the same government pension insurance as normal employees instead of the complicated system we have now.
F3: This is a proposal that a lot of people agree with, but it’s not exactly something that makes the masses enthusiastic.
A4: We have to resist any impulse to raise the entry age for pensions beyond 67, guarantee the level of pensions or even raise it. The poverty of some pensioners is also something that needs to be combatted relentlessly.
F4: You are perhaps not the right man to sell this program. Not increasing the pension age and higher pensions are popular, but it’s unclear how this can be financed - and since you’ve been a proponent of fiscal stability in the past, this makes you look indecisive.
