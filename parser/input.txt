Q1:
A1: This is how the Dice have fallen. It seems my party does not want me, rather to embark on a new course. It’s clear, this is the end of my career - if my political allies do not have faith in me, how could the German people? Tomorrow, I am going to offer my resignation to chancellor Merkel. Time to buy a good rowboat and enjoy my retirement.
F1: Seeing how viscerally the party has rejected your political identity, your reaction is understandable. Merkel is hesitant to let a good man go, but in the end, accepts your resignation. Hubertus Heil becomes the new Vice Chancellor, while Bettina Hagedorn becomes new Minister of Finances. You had a good go, Olaf - you earned this. Rolf will do his best to win the German people over, with his pitch: “Social Politics For You”.

A2: I need to safeguard the accomplishments of this coalition - my work has not been for naught! I know that many Genossen see it as I do, blindly driving leftwards is not a recipe for success. Over the next few weeks, I will, both privately and publicly, remind the party that good governance is the first commandment of any political offer.
F2: The centrist Seeheimer-wing of the party embraces you as a leader, and your repeated side-eyeing becomes a thorn in Rolf Mützenich’s side. Despite your doubts that he’ll win this thing, you run for office once more, thinking that you’re the only one who can stop this ship from capsizing leftwards. Until then, leadership is trying to prove you wrong, with their new pitch: “Social Politics For You”.

A3: Well, it was worth a shot, but I am unfazed in the wake of this development. Rolf is a capable leader. While I doubt he has a shot, further involving myself would only bring chaos to the campaign - I will endorse his bid with earnesty and grace, and then keep on working in my job as Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finances. That’s what I owe to the German people.
F3: While a few journalists heckle your middling political record, Esken and NoWaBo are happy about your grace, and you continue your work unfazed. Over the coming months, you prove your leadership capabilities at several points - maybe your rising popularity numbers can be extended for Rolf’s electoral success, with his campaign: “Social Politics For You”.

A4: The love of my life is my wife, but not far behind lies the Good Old SPD. Despite our differences, I want to reconcile with Saskia,. Norbert and Rolf and offer them my energy and spirit to serve as a surrogate in this campaign. The next decade has to be a Social Democratic one, and I will stop at nothing to ensure a victory for our party.
F4: Rolf is happy that you’re a teamplayer, and you become a top-tier surrogate for him to extend a hand to the moderate wing of the SPD. While your campaigning style seems stilted and awkward now and then, keeping the party united behind its candidate is a must if the performances of last years are to be avoided. Alright Olaf - let’s fight for “Social Politics For You”.
