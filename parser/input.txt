Laschet verliert gegen Merz
Q1: In a close contest against Friedrich Merz, you have lost. The Merkel wing of the CDU is alarmed – Merz' comeback has truly succeeded, while you have faltered. Was it because of complacency, arrogance even? Or was the CDU just fed up with centrism? Either way, it's clear what his next ambition will be – the chancellor candidacy. Meanwhile, what shall be your next steps?


A1: I need to draw political consequences from this bitter loss. If not even my own party can accept my leadership, I doubt North Rhine-Westphalia stands behind my political course. I will talk to my protegé, Hendrik Wüst, that I am stepping down from my role as Minister President. I just want to retire.
F1: The CDU in NRW accepts your resignation, and Hendrik Wüst is voted to be the next Minister-President. Meanwhile, you retire to Aachen, going back to teaching maybe. Your brief political spotlight has passed – Merz goes on to win the chancellor candidacy, and on election eve, you wonder about what could've been…
A2: One thing is clear now – Merz may be party leader, but his polling numbers are abysmal compared to Markus Söder. My Bavarian collegue clearly has some ambitions – maybe he can still save our party. I will publicly endorse his endeavor to become the Union candidate and Angela Merkels successor.
F2: Party loyalty, shrewd strategizing or just a bad loser? Either way, Merz takes badly to your final slight. Nonetheless, as more and more establishment figures line up behind Söder, he has to accept that once again, he has been booted from the spotlight. Söder goes on to try to win for the Union cause, and you help him as much as you can, while Merz is suspiciously silent. On election eve, you seem vindicated…
A3: Okay, this endeavour might've been a failure, but I am still popular in my home state of NRW. I will focus my political attention on my actual calling as Minister-President – Merz can do his own thing, I don't think he'll even want my engagement.
F3: There are few rumbles about a leadership challenge in NRW, but they don't come to pass. During election season, you participate in an event out of courtesy with Merz, but seeing the dramatic campaign that unfolds, secretly, you're a bit glad you haven't strung up your entire career on the chancellor candidacy, looking at the results…
A4: I'll be a fair loser and gracefully accept this loss. Our party has chosen a clear path with Friedrich Merz – he is a capable and competent man, and our main task should be to have Mr. Merz be elected as the next chancellor of Germany. I will do everything in my power to help do just that.
F4: Merz appreciates your help, and with a swift endorsement by you, pulls through against Söder to become the next chancellor candidate of the Union. You stump for him in your own home state, but also across the country, putting up a united front for the controversial man. It might be crucial for him to win over the moderates he needs…


Laschet lässt Söder den Vortritt
Q1: It has been a hard decision indeed – maybe one of the most painful days of your political career. Your endorsement of Söder as chancellor candidate gives him the last edge to become the third CSU candidate of the Union. His polling numbers look great, and with a united front, it seems the CDU/CSU might continue its dominance, even after 16 years of Merkel. After this whole ordeal, you’re of course still party leader - what will be your next steps?
A1: As pragmatic as it might've been, this was just too painful. I need to draw political consequences from this bitter loss. After the election, the CDU will have another leadership contest, and I am going to step down from my position as Minister-President of NRW. l talk to my protegé, Hendrik Wüst, to arrange the rest. I just want to retire.
F1: Many are a bit surprised how you are completely dropping the towel so soon, while others think it's fair how you are retiring early, after being defeated politically so early in your leadership. You help out Söder however you can, and polls show Merz to be ahead in a third leadership challenge against Merkel's confidante Helge Braun. You retire to Aachen, and wistfully observe election eve, wondering what could've been…
A2: Okay, this endeavor might've been a failure, but I am still popular in my home state of NRW. I will focus my political attention on my actual calling as Minister-President and leader of the CDU – Söder can do his own thing, I don't think he'll even want my engagement. The man loves the spotlight anyways…
F2: Söder is very disappointed about your lack of engagement with him. He snubs you in return, and the tension between the Union parties does him no favors during the election season. Even inside your party, many are calling you a bad loser, and slowly, cries for your resignation as party leader start to emerge. Hopefully the election won’t be too bad…
A3: Alright, as sad as it might be, Söder is just our best shot at continuing the Union dominance on a federal level. Let's support him however we can – holding events, stumping for him, and keeping the Union united.
F3: Söder appreciates the gesture, and you carry a lot of goodwill – in fact, your popularity numbers actually rise in the wake of your humble generosity. Söder goes into the campaign with good tailwinds, and who knows? Maybe this actually helps advance your own political career even further. Just think of Helmut Kohl in 1980...

Laschet verliert gegen Söder
Q1:You fought with valor and bravery, but it wasn't enough. Even your own party seemingly saw the signs, and in a final vote in the party group, supported Söder over you. You are publicly humiliated, but have no choice but to accept the verdict of the party. Your apparatus offers you to stay on as party leader for now, but regardless, your political standing is damaged. What will be your next steps now, in light of Söders chancellor candidacy?
A1: This is absolutely humiliating - how am I supposed to keep working like this? I don’t want to ruffle any feathers now in time for the election, but I need to draw political consequences from this bitter loss. After the election, the CDU will have another leadership contest, and I am going to step down from my position as Minister-President of NRW. l talk to my protegé, Hendrik Wüst, to arrange the rest. I just want to retire.
F1: Many are a bit surprised how you are completely dropping the towel so soon, while others think it's fair how you are retiring early, after being defeated politically so early in your leadership.

F3: Söder appreciates the gesture, and you show yourself a graceful loser. In fact, a good chunk of your party seems relieved about this outcome. Söder goes into the campaign with good tailwinds, and who knows? Maybe this actually helps advance your own political career even further. Just think of Helmut Kohl in 1980...
A4: I will not accept this! I am Merkel’s successor and the party chief of the CDU. The upstage of this narcissistic opportunist from Bavaria won’t drive our campaign into the ground. I am going to talk to the presidium, and they will share my concerns!
F4: Are you mad? The presidium does hear you out - and after your attitude leaks, they pressure you to step down. The CDU is once again without a leader - and you have completely disgraced yourself with this childish outburst. The NRW-CDU also demands your resignation, giving the reins over to Hendrik Wüst. You’ve exiled yourself, congratulations.
