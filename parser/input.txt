Q1:
A2: We are doing a lot to get everyone vaccinated right now without thinking about the consequences. What if the vaccine is toxic? We shouldn’t underestimate alternative medicine, and we should support people’s freedom to choose homeopathic medicine instead.
F2: There is a tiny fragment of society - the “natural medicine” crowd - that forms a swing voter block between Greens and AfD. After your earlier stance on Covid, SPD and CDU bat no eye to suspect a closeness between the Greens and the <i>Querdenker</i>-movement. Of course, your party immediately rebukes this, but they also sharply criticize you for such a misstep. Tread lightly.

It’s clear who’s at fault for this electoral poison - it’s you. Party leadership comes to you to explain that you have to resign. Only moments later, Robert calls. “We gotta talk”, he says. “about the candidate exchange.”

PACIFIST

A4: The Green Party is a party of pacifism, and we’ve been against this war in Afghanistan from the start. While the pictures are tragic and we need to do what we can to help, this whole episode shows why we shouldn’t get involved in these types of conflicts.
F4: Over the course of this campaign, you’ve seemingly tried to resummon the pacifist spirit the Greens were founded in. It starts to pay off with a few Leftists - but both CDU and SPD don’t hesitate to obliterate you over this blatant lie, as well as your “naiveté”. A call from Robert follows: He just had to can a message from the Russian ambassador. You’re playing a dangerous game, and privately, he suspects it might be better if you lose.

F4: The Green Party voted for the Afghanistan mission and was even part of the government in 2001. After your earlier lie concerning your CV, journalists ask if you can be trusted to tell the truth to Germans - and of course, your opponents are quick to ask the same thing.

Q24A2 wenn Q11A3 und Q22A4
A2: I want to hit him on his scandals, both as finance minister and earlier. He mishandled the Wirecard collapse, was involved in the cum-ex banking scandal and had a disastrous response to the G20 meeting when he was mayor of Hamburg.
F2: Laschet starts the debate by hitting Scholz on the Wirecard affair - and you keep piling it on. Unfortunately, he is quick to retort - by calling you out on your lies and Laschet on his gaffes, the whole debate becomes a mudfest. Afterwards, viewers and the press agree - the loser of this debate was Germany.

KRISENMANAGEMENT
Q32A1 wenn Q15A1
A1: Mr. Laschet’s crisis responses are erratic and unreliable. He can not hold a clear line on Covid, he can not stand up to pressure and corruption from his own party, and his response to the disastrous floods this summer shows that he lacks the temperament to be a good chancellor. Germany deserves someone better than him.
F1: A pretty harsh tone, but Laschet is quick to take you to task about your invisibility during the crisis. You two trade a few blows, segueing into climate policy. During all that, standing in the corner, silently smirking, is Olaf Scholz. An overwhelming majority of people believe him to be the winner, and the only one capable of performing the duties of a chancellor.

Both parties are at fault.
F1: You seem to gamble that joining the mudslinging is worth it - but in the ensuing chaos, every party seems to be rebuked trying to profit off of the suffering of millions of Afghans. As the Left refuses to back the rescue mission and the AfD unelectable for most people, the FDP might stand to gain from this crisis, if anyone.

F4: “Minor adjustments” is quickly becoming what you’re known for. Over the course of this campaign, you have espoused a gradual reformism - that has its appeals to centrists, but others, even inside the SPD in this case, advocate for much more change. Already, the narrative of the race has changed in favor of the Social Democrats.

I don’t want to jeopardize this: instead, the two men won’t be able to refrain from attacks, and I'll calmly rise above the pack.
F2: Annalena Baerbock? More like Annalena keinen Bock mehr.

F1: Despite you competing for the same voters, Scholz didn’t expect an attack from you - however, your own policies don’t much differ from his, even going right of his sometimes. As Laschet embodies the Status Quo by default, in a twist of fate, the incumbent Vice Chancellor manages to envelop himself in a mantle of progressivism, winning him the debate.

Armin Laschet is the candidate of standstill politics: he is against more investments and against the duly needed modernization of Germany. When we look at the unchanged problems in our country - I think it’s time for change.
F3: While you do embody a new type of political brand for people, the timid policy proposals and constrained reformism you espoused over the course of this campaign muddles this message. While you are vague and untargeted, Laschet points to his real government record. Meanwhile Scholz is regarded the winner of the night, with you in last place.

F1: Your pitch is muddled by the timid policies you’ve cautiously espoused, and the moderate demeanor you’ve surrounded yourself with. It just doesn’t suit you. Instead, the aggressive tone of Laschet and Scholz’ unwavering gravitas dominate the media cycle. The Vice Chancellor prevails in the duel, and you’re treated like an also-ran.

That said, the other side of the country likes Merkel’s patience - and it’s not Laschet but Scholz who can convince them.

A1: We need to send the Union back to the opposition - they are the party of standstill. While we definitely advocate for a stricter line on climate change, the party we have the most overlap with is the SPD. In the end, maybe it’ll even be enough for an alliance solely between Green and Red.
F1: It’s true that the SPD and Greens are each other's preferred coalition partners, even looking back to 7 years of Red-Green under Gerhard Schröder. However, the party system of Germany has changed, and most think it improbable that there will be a two-party-majority for the both of you - meanwhile, you’re dodging the question of cooperating with Die Linke.
A2: While we of course disavow any cooperation with the AfD, I also can not imagine a good working relationship with Die Linke. I want to see an administration that takes responsibility in the world - if we don’t share common ground on foreign policy, there is no basis for a government.
F2: With this strong statement, you’re driving a harsher lane than Scholz, effectively silencing Laschet's attacks on you. This is kind of strange, considering you’ve handled openly anticapitalist talking points - you also disappoint many younger voters and left-wingers previously hopeful for a political revolution.
A3: Equating Die Linke with the far right AfD, as the CDU does, is wildly dangerous. The best path to real change in our government lies in a cooperation of the three leftist parties: such an arrangement has worked in several states already, so I’m certain we can find compromises on contentious topics.
F3: This plays right into Laschet's criticisms of you, and no matter how you spin it, it frightens moderates fearful of the SED successor-party. Die Linke has given you clear signs of sympathy for entering a government under you - if you can convince the SPD to give this country a restart, Germany might be headed into a decade of unwavering leftism.
A4: This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition.
F4: You’ve taken a liking to the “Pasta-connection” of 2019, it seems. Political observers are baffled - how is your economic policy ever to be compatible with the FDP? Lindner is quick to disavow your advances, preferring Laschet as a coalition partner. You might need some new friends…

Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance.
F4: A strong stance that pivots leftwards - you really seem to gamble that by dragging culture wars into this race, you can consolidate the left around you. Your internet presence is already under siege from right-wing trolls. That said, your language echoes that of Die Linke in 2017, which might open you up to more attacks from the center.

F3: With your unabashed leftism, and Die Linke unable to define itself as a dominant political force, you might knock them out of the Bundestag for good, the first time in twenty years. If you play your cards right and they don’t win a third direct mandate, you could really simplify the creation of a political majority.

F2: With this strong statement, you’re driving a harsher lane than Scholz, effectively silencing Laschet's attacks on you. This is certain to gather further points among moderates, for many of whom this question was a hold-up to supporting you. Considering you’ve built on a neoliberal policy outlook, The Left doesn’t want to deal with you anyways.
A3: Equating Die Linke with the far right AfD, as the CDU does, is wildly dangerous. The best path to real change in our government lies in a cooperation of the three leftist parties: such an arrangement has worked in several states already, so I’m certain we can find compromises on contentious topics.
F3: This plays right into Laschet's criticisms of you, and no matter how you spin it, it frightens moderates fearful of the SED successor-party. This is particularly baffling to political observants, given how your policy platform differs vastly from their democratic socialism. Maybe this defense can endear you to them?
A4: This is a historic moment in our society and in our country; we need a restart in Germany’s governmental politics. The FDP is closer to us than many might think: we are both advocating for change. Together, we can drive a hard bargain against the old parties of the Grand Coalition.
F4: You’ve taken a liking to the “Pasta-connection” of 2019, it seems. The FDP is quite curious about you, and as several young liberal and Green MP’s have already started informal coalition talks, a Jamaica- or Traffic Light coalition lies in the air. Hopefully with you at the helm!

A3: I’d like to focus on our social policies. It’s not the fault of climate action that people get paid too little, that the minimum wage is too low and that every fifth child lives in poverty. That’s because of policies that intend to mainly relieve high-earners and which do not look at poverty in Germany.
F3: You tear into Laschet’s economic plans - but so does Scholz, who, surprisingly, starts to tie you into his criticism as well. The SPD has flanked you from the left over the course of this campaign, and riffing on the theme of “Respect”, it’s him who profits from this area of policy the most. Viewers seem to think he won the Triell.

Forty years ago, the Green Party was founded to make our politics care more about the environment. Today, I continue in this tradition, as the only candidate that truly takes climate change seriously.
F2: Although most thought Habeck would win out, your party is as fired up as ever by your spirited defense of the party’s main identity. Is it enough to win? As countless environmental organizations proclaim their loyalty to you, you are the unopposed flagbearer of the climate movement going into the 2020’s. “Ready, because you are”.

F4: The interviewer is (perhaps positively) surprised - your clear pivot is noted by the media. Your friends in Fridays For Future warn you, should you keep this up, they are going to run their own lists in selective places. Maybe, if you can triangulate, this stance can still mollify centrists without aggravating them too much.

F2: Some are happy about your lack of grandstanding, while others, especially the Fridays For Future movement, are irritated about your dodge. They make a public statement connecting this event to climate change, criticizing you in the same breath. Perhaps, this can establish you as an independent thinker?

F3: Leftist infighting, a classic - and in the ensuing debate, Scholz gets the best of you.  Through your timid policy stances on climate over the course of this campaign, you just don’t have a lot of ammunition to criticize him. With environmentalists around the country aggravated, Laschet seems to sell his vision best to the average voter.

He does not provide any new concepts on climate action, he’s just always “against”. This attitude is hurting Germany’s industrial future!
F2: This is a biting critique of Laschet, but - “Where’s the beef?” Scholz asks. Your own stances turn out to be equally as vague as the two men’s on stage! Even the Animal Protection Party offers more meat and potatoes. Scholz himself puts up a surprisingly competent defense of his own party’s record, gaining decent reviews even from your allies.

F2: This is the classic answer for a Green, but unfortunately, through the number of pivots you’ve made over the course of this campaign, the message gets muddled. Viewers aren’t convinced of your uninspired rhetoric, and polls put you into last place behind Laschet and Scholz.

A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: Cautious, but realistic and solution-oriented. Feminism is one of the core tenets of Green politics, and your answer satisfies most advocates. The uncontroversial nature of this answer keeps the issue out of the limelight - to the chagrin of a few activists, who expected more from you.
A2: We want to strike $218, and 219 from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: As you stand tall on social issues, you drag the Culture Wars into this race. The Greens are firmly embedded within the feminist movement, and as a few CSU and AfD politicians start to hit on your course, you get to define yourself as the definitive option for social progressives.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: This is a gigantic pivot to the Right, making the headline news. After all, the Greens were born from the New Social Movements of the 60’s and 70’s - feminism is a core tenet of Green politics! The entire political spectrum is irritated about this blunder, as people wonder if you misspoke, misunderstood the question or are just an unpredictable maverick.

F4: Well, with your steadfast stance on the progressive side of the Culture Wars, the only thing you achieve is even more posturing, while the AfD consolidates its base in opposition to you.

F1: People noticed that you took an unexpectedly conservative turn in your rhetoric, with core voters from the Greens like feminists, sexual minorities and antifascists unnerved. Maybe this can mollify them - but don’t count on it, after your noteworthy pivots…
A2: We want to strike $218, and 219 from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: People noticed that you took an unexpectedly conservative turn in your rhetoric, with core voters from the Greens like feminists, sexual minorities and antifascists unnerved. That said, this option proves that you still have some social progressivism left within you - feminists might return to your campaign, even if begrudgingly.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: People noticed that you took an unexpectedly conservative turn in your rhetoric, with core voters from the Greens like feminists, sexual minorities and antifascists unnerved. This statement is now the last straw - with many agelong members leaving the party for the SPD, Left and Animal Protection party, observers wonder about your self-sabotage.
A4: We need to immediately strike § 218, 219 and 219a) - instead, the right to free, simple and accessible abortions has to be guaranteed; state-built hospitals should be required to perform the procedure. Furthermore, with contraceptives ensuring the right for self-determination, they should be fully covered by insurance.
F4: People noticed that you took an unexpectedly conservative turn in your rhetoric, with core voters from the Greens like feminists, sexual minorities and antifascists unnerved - but, what a twist! On this issue, you’re left of almost every other major party! No one’s really sure what you’re trying to achieve here, except confuse the voters. Expect a deep, dark drop in the polls.

A1: Okay, hear me out. This campaign needs a wildcard. This whole time, the Greens are always portrayed as “woke” or something. We could really turn some heads if we show that we’re serious about my pivot on refugees, and there’s only one person in our party who could do that: Boris Palmer.
F1: Annalena, that’s, that’s a joke… right? …no? Alright shit, Michael, it’s too late to swap in Habeck now, just give her the appearance and we’ll try to bury it. What, the media already got wind of it? Oh god… okay, Annalena, play it off as “reconciliation” and “talking with everyone”, okay? Those media people will rip you a new one… better hope they’re “Ready, because you are”...

A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the Greens have a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F5: Merz competently rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show some backbone and confidence to your party. Now, it’s time now to huddle down in your home in Potsdam, and hope that you can accomplish your goal of “Ready, because you are”.

A4: They might be a bit weaker than they were four years ago, but the amount of votes the AfD is projected to receive is still way too high. It should be every democratic party’s duty to keep the nationalists out of parliament. Let’s show off their misgivings.
F4: People were already guessing that with the large rightwards pivots on cultural issues you’ve made over the last few months, you were trying to fish in rightwards waters. Surprisingly, a small chunk of voters for whom “Climate Protection is Homeland protection” is receptive to that take. Apart from them though, you’ve almost certainly lost big parts of your traditional base to the SPD, the Left and the Animal Protection Party.


Q999A2 wenn Linke Richtungsfrage
A2: With Scholz’s newfound strength, we need to hone in on his voter base. By emphasizing our progressive policies and commitment to a change in Germany’s political consensus, I’ll win back the center-left to our cause.
F2: As people’s trust in the SPD’s genuineness has faltered ever since the Agenda 2010, the Greens have finally positioned themselves as the definitive alternative for the left. Although taken by Scholz’s gravitas, a lot of younger Social Democrats take a second look at your candidacy - don’t let them down in the final stages of this race.

Q999A3 wenn Likeability >14
A3: We’ve held our own in this race for a long time. Now, we just have to get across the finish line! Every vote counts, and with a renewed focus on rallies, media visibility and ad campaigns, we’ll pull ahead of the pack.
F3: Focusing on turnout helps your numbers without opening yourself up to counterattacks. Your good favorability numbers pay off, as your rallies become large media events, outnumbering the attendants of your two opponents. Perhaps this wasn’t such a bad idea!

A3: We’ve held our own in this race for a long time. Now, we just have to get across the finish line! Every vote counts, and with a renewed focus on rallies, media visibility and ad campaigns, we’ll pull ahead of the pack.
F3: Your new focus isn’t bad, but as attacks from Laschet, and even a few sideswipes from Scholz’s camp follow, your passivity does little to redefine the race. Instead, the ascendant SPD and a reorganized CDU campaign largely take over the headlines, in what seems to become another duel between the two giants.

Q999A4 wenn Likeability >14
A4: Both Scholz and Laschet are old, white men, involved with the GroKo - both stand for the continuation of the status quo. I will heavily lean into my age and gender to present myself as the modern option for change in this country. Only a Green chancellery can reform what needs to be reformed.
F4: With you as a popular figurehead of this new movement, you seem to drive the political discourse forward. While there’s a significant part of the population voting on competence instead of rabble-rousing, your message seems genuinely inspiring in contrast to your drab opponents.

F4: Unfortunately, while many people want change, the gravitas of your opponents wins out. To be blunt, many people just don’t trust you to lead this country, ever since your likeability numbers have dropped into toxicity.
