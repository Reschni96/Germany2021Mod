CDU-Söder

Q1: January 2021: After Merkel's announcement of retirement, her initial handpicked successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has faltered in just 3 years. Instead, the CDU has just elected North Rhine-Westphalian Minister President Armin Laschet as their new party leader. Politicians across the political spectrum are congratulating him. As leader of the smaller Bavarian sister party, CSU, what do you want to say?
A1: I will offer my congratulations to Armin Laschet, for winning the leadership competition. Together, we will keep writing the success story of the CDU/CSU. I’m looking forward to a close cooperation.
F1: A regal, complimentary tone that satisfies the party is appreciated by Laschet. The media notices your silence on the elephant in the room: it’s long been speculated that you have your own ambitions on the real price - the chancellor candidacy.
A2: Publicly, I of course want to congratulate him for winning the leadership election, to not rock any boats in the partnership of our parties. However, I’m worried that a guy like him will lose us the election in the fall. Behind the scenes, I will prepare my strike for what really counts: the chancellor candidacy.
F2: It seems wise to bide your time here and not immediately challenge him. The chatter about your scheming of course doesn’t stop, and Laschet notices - but in time, gathering your resources and sorting out your strategy might help you swipe the crown from his head.
A3: Of course I will congratulate him. However, I want to make it clear that him being party leader does not automatically make him chancellor candidate. I’ll make some remarks that we will have to sort this question out later.
F3: …and the cockfight continues. Many in the CDU are shocked that you’re attacking their leader right out the gate, and the headlines jump on what was maybe the clearest statement on your ambitions yet. This competition isn’t over, the real battle begins now: The Union’s chancellor candidacy.
A4: First, I want to congratulate him publicly. At the same time, let’s reach out to some of the people who supported his opponents in the leadership election and start convincing them that I am the better chancellor candidate. I know that Norbert Röttgen made some veiled overtures to me..
F4: Your quick statement satisfies the CDU, but it’s clear to everyone that you have your own ambitions. You’re lucky none of your schemes are leaked, but a surprising number of CDU politicians are receptive to your good poll numbers compared to Laschet, while the CSU seems largely united behind you. Forging connections might indeed help you later on, in winning the big prize: The chancellor candidacy…

Q2: It’s clear to you that Laschet is a weak candidate, a weak leader. Many expect you to challenge him - it might finally be time for a Bavarian chancellor. Privately, you’re up for it - but coming out with it now would be hasty. To grow your influence in the party and the country, what will be your course of action over the next few months.
A1: I’m already quite well known among the German people, but it’s time to give my profile a boost, so that people think of me instead of him when talking about Christian Democracy. Let’s go to every talk show that wants to have me and make sure people see my face constantly.
F1: You’re already pretty ubiquitous in the political landscape, and you’re very popular for talk shows like <i> Markus Lanz </i> or <i>Anne Will</i>. Your personal numbers keep rising, and Laschet seems a bit invisible to onlookers..
A2: My polling is better than Laschets, but the chancellor candidacy isn’t a popularity contest: it’s about connections. I will speak with as many CDU functionaries as I can in the coming weeks, to start getting them on my side. I know our youth organization JU is quite receptive to me.
F2: You’re right - in time, you have almost every states’ JU-chapter on your side. Even CDU minister-presidents Reiner Haseloff of Saxony-Anhalt and Tobias Hans of the Saarland seem receptive to your efforts. While this does put the pressure on Laschet, it also alerts him and his allies that you’re up to something…
A3: I’m already the darling of our party base. The CDU leadership will have to acknowledge this, and pick me over Laschet. Right now, I want to start focusing on the general election and attack the SPD and the Greens whenever an opportunity presents itself. As someone not intricately involved in Merkel's administration, I‘m able to make a good attack dog.
F3: Your gamble could actually pay off, if you can believe it. Both the general populace and your party base seem to be enamored with you, quite more than the bland Armin Laschet. Meanwhile, you’re already in full campaign mode - over the next few weeks, you get in some good attacks on your opponents, setting you up with a comfortable lead going into the election.
A4: It would probably backfire if I were to personally attack the CDU, so I will do nothing of the sort. However, I’m sure there are plenty of CSU politicians who can find things to be critical of. I will talk to my party behind the scenes to lead the push against Laschet as the Unions candidate.
F4: Delightfully devilish, Söder. Over the coming weeks, Laschet has to defend himself again and again before his own conservative apparatus. There’s talk in the press about the disunity between CDU and CSU,  but his favorability numbers get dragged down more than yours. Let’s hope you’re able to mend the rift once you’re the face of the Union.

Q3: March 2021: COVID-19 has shaped the lives of people in Germany and across the world for the past years. Now that the winter is over, a lot of people are demanding an end to the harsh lockdowns. As Minister-President of Bavaria, you could chart a new course for your government. What is your stance on this?
A1: I’ve been known as a lockdown hardliner in the past. However, it’s clear people are starting to grumble - the situation in Bavaria is quite good compared to other states, so we should be able to loosen up our measures and open up fairly quickly. We’re a Free State, not a Constraint State.
F1: At first, your pivot seems to be well received. However, as the climate warms up over the spring, cases start surging again - to prevent a catastrophe, your state administration goes back on your promises to open up and reintroduces lockdown-measures. Political opponents criticize you sharply for your carelessness, as does famous virologist Christian Drosten.
A2: The situation is still very volatile, so I will keep doing what I’ve been doing for the whole pandemic so far and stay on a hard line against Covid. There will be no premature openings in Bavaria.
F2: At first, people are grumbling, but when cases start to surge again in the spring, this looks like a good call. Not all are satisfied though - some view prolonged lockdowns as unconstitutional, especially in East Germany, and some Bavarians don’t like that their state is stricter than most others.
A3: Throughout the pandemic, people have looked to me for leadership even outside of Bavaria and I have to maintain my outsized role in this discourse. I will call for whatever seems more popular at the moment: Bavaria as the land of Caution, Bavaria as the land of Proportionality, Bavaria as the land of Freedom… any way the wind blows.
F3: You are known for being opportunistic, but you are also very good at it. While critics note your measures follow less scientific recommendations, and more popular opinion; with a topic like covid, your equivocations seem to pay off among the voters. More and more people in Germany wish they had you in charge of things.
A4: I support Armin Laschet's proposal of a Bridge-lockdown over Easter, until enough people are vaccinated. I’ve always been in support of measures like this, and so has the chancellor.
F4: In light of everything, it might not be a bad thing to conjure up some unity. However, Laschets proposals seem confusing to many, and are quite controversial. Playing second fiddle here doesn’t do you much favors.

Q4: You’ve been invited to a talk show to talk about tax policy and the “Black Zero”, which mandates a balanced budget. The left and left-of-center seek more investments, paid for by taxing the rich, while the FDP seeks widespread tax reductions. How do you want to frame the position of your party?
A1: Under no circumstances will we raise taxes, but we don’t want to dramatically lower them either. We will phase out the extra tax of the Soli and try to reduce the burden on small and medium-income earners while always keeping the budget balanced, in keeping with the “Black Zero”.
F1: This is quite cautious and unsentimental for a power player like you. Your CDU colleague, former Minister of Finance and current President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Black Zero”, thanks you in private: he might be a valuable asset, but is currently firmly in Laschet's camp.
A2: The Covid crisis has left a massive hole in our budget that we have to plug somehow. We have to be measured, but a tax increase will likely be unavoidable to avoid harsh debts that can hurt our economy even further.
F2: A brutally honest answer, but honesty isn’t always well received, as the FDP and AfD make hay from disappointed market liberals. Leftists aren’t going to vote for you on that promise either. Paddling unpopular policies certainly aren’t helpful for your scheming - the inconsistencies with earlier stances are negatively noted by your base.
A3: Taxes for private households should stay where they are or even be lowered by phasing out the Soli. More importantly, corporate taxes should be lowered to unleash the full economic potential of this country. As little State as necessary, as much market as possible.
F3: A small pivot for you, but an inspiring message to campaign on - classic Christian-Social economics. However, former Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Black Zero”, fears more state debt without running a tighter fiscal ship - but the inroads with the electorate might be worth it to you.
A4: The most important thing we can do now is lower the taxes for small and medium-income earners, our tax policy is failing them. Besides that, I’ll mainly attack the tax plans of the other parties.
F4: A bit of a populist tone, but that is on-brand for you. You’re winning the personality battle in the talk show and draw applause from fiscal conservatives, without having to box yourself in on policy. Your equivocations seem to work for now, but you better have a plan ready for the election.

Q5: Irritated, you read the headline of the 11/2021 issue of<i> Der Spiegel</i>: <br>” <i>‘Schwarzer Filz’ - Mask deals, venality, failure in crisis: the deep fall of the Union. </i> “<br>They reveal how several CDU/CSU MPs are implicated as part of a corrupt scheme to sell overpriced medical masks to government organizations, in order to profit from the crisis. Journalists run in your door, asking for a comment on this crisis, especially as several Bavarian politicians are involved.
A1: I’m as shocked and outraged as everyone else when this came to light. There will be new rules for members of my party that they have to make all earnings public, to prevent something like this from happening again.
F1: While the CDU/CSU as a whole is hurt by this scandal, you do try to mitigate its worst effects. It turns out the CSU  is deeply affected, and even your wife has to testify, but your proactive steps show that you’re at least doing something.
A2: Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened. Luckily, it seems like the CDU is in more trouble than the CSU, so maybe I can use this to paint me as a more competent party leader.
F2: Journalists keep heckling you for more of a comment - this comes off as very suspicious, especially as more and more of these corrupt dealings come to light. When even more details reveal themselves, the CSU ends up in an especially bad light - and even your own wife has to testify. This damages both your personally and the party as a whole.
A3: This is nothing but a political hit job by a left-wing magazine in an election year. I’m sure further investigations will prove the innocence of these MPs.
F3: Look, <i>Der Spiegel </i>isn’t The Jacobin. Nobody is buying this, as the report is well sourced and new details come out almost every day. This makes you seem very out of touch with the public mood; some right-wingers on social media praise you, but the AfD seeks to profit from government corruption.
A4: We have to deflect from this as much as possible. I will make it clear that I have zero tolerance for corruption, but I will refrain from any incendiary statements. I don’t want to get associated with this personally.
F4: At first, you keep out of the headlines, but the scandal becomes too big to downplay. The Union as a whole suffers a serious crisis in confidence, and while your own numbers stay relatively intact, the hype around you takes a backseat to negative headlines.

Q6: April 2021: It’s getting serious. Minister of Finance and current Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been declared chancellor candidate by the SPD last year already and there are rumors the Green party is about to nominate either Annalena Baerbock or Robert Habeck next. It’s clear that Laschet is looking to announce his candidacy soon as well - now might be the time to strike. How do you want to go about challenging the CDU leader?
A1: I have to be careful here, I don’t want to come across as too power-hungry. First, I will call Laschet and tell him that I think a challenge would be best for the party, and then tentatively acknowledge my ambitions to the media.
F1: Obviously, he is not thrilled, and while the CSU supports you, the CDU seems split. As leader of the bigger sister party, he does have a traditional prerogative after all. Your careful announcement seems a bit anticlimactic, but the confrontation escalates regardless. It seems you will have to duke it out in the coming weeks.
A2: It’s an open secret my true goal is the chancellor candidacy. Let’s not beat around the bush -  let’s make an announcement as soon as possible to catch Laschet by surprise. If he has to catch up, we can paint him in an even worse light.
F2: Your announcement, although expected, lands as a bombshell - the fight for the candidacy is on. Only a day later, Laschet declared his candidacy as well. While this might have gotten you a small advantage for moving first, it also makes you seem power-hungry and a bit nefarious. Hopefully, you can come out on top.
A3: Doing this the wrong way could backfire - my appeal lies in my popularity, so let’s work through that. I’ll have my supporters in the CDU and CSU demand that I save the party from Laschet's bad polling numbers, and then - “reluctantly” - declare my candidacy.
F3: A devious plot, but framing the whole thing around your poll numbers and pretending to only want what’s best for the party seems reasonable to many. The hype around your candidacy keeps going, but Laschet will surely put up a fight.

Q7: You and Armin Laschet both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU, in an intra-party competition not seen since 2002. Back then, your predecessor Stoiber won out against Merkel, but lost in the general election. These days, while Laschet has the bully pulpit as leader of the national party, popular opinion polls show you ahead. How do you want to go about settling this?
A1: Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.
F1: Unfortunately, the party elites are still on the CDU leader’s side after all. Through the influence of people like Wolfgang Schäuble and Volker Bouffier, Armin Laschet prevails and is declared to be the next chancellor candidate for the Union. You swiftly accept the result, but your audacity damaged your standing in the party. There’s no way around it: You lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A2: During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.
F2: After days of pressure from within his own party, and seeing the numbers himself, Laschet eventually withdraws his candidacy in your favor. The way forwards is clear - the chancellor candidacy is yours. However, your aggressive push left a sour taste in the mouth of many colleagues, and you’ll have to mend the rift in order to get your campaign going: “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F3: While you present a solid argument, and do get crossparty support, it turns out that your grandstanding has alienated certain MP’s alike. Laschet turns out to be the narrow winner in the contest, and you’re forced to accept the result. While you stand aside with grace and keep your popularity in the Union, there’s no way around it: you lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F4: The vote is close - but in the end, your gamble seems to work. With many MP’s fearing to get smothered with Laschet as a candidate, you come out as the winner. The CDU leader accepts the vote and steps aside in your favor, pleading for a united Union. While this whole ordeal took a lot of resources, the party seems to finally unite around your candidacy: “So Germany stays stable”.

Q8: You’ve done it. The Union has accepted you as their candidate - Laschet retreats with his tail between his legs, and you stand victorious. <br> Of course, you never really doubted this outcome - but it still feels good to finally have taken over as the 3rd CSU candidate for chancellor, to follow up on Merkel's leadership. Congratulations! What talking point do you want to hit on at the press conference?
A1: First and foremost, I want to thank Armin Laschet for this fair competition. I want to plead for a united Union, to continue our successful governance of Germany. Apart from that, I will hit my usual talking points.
F1: Party unity is always a good thing, and both the CDU as a whole and the important state party in North Rhine-Westphalia like hearing this. Laschet himself is still sulking a bit, but in time, he picks up the slack and campaigns for you among his supporters.
A2: If you want to look at how I want to govern this country, look at Bavaria. We are one of the most successful states by a big number of metrics and my popularity there speaks for itself. As an accomplished leader of the Free State, Germany will shine just as bright.
F2: Bavarians like this speech a lot, and the CSU is especially energized for the first Bavarian chancellor. Your party has a dubious reputation in Germany overall though, and there are some regionalist rivalries at play. Hopefully, you can overcome this during your campaign.
A3: It’s clear that the two most important topics this election are Covid and climate change. I will guide Germany through the pandemic like I guided Bavaria, and I will make sure our transition to renewable energies goes along smoothly. I will continue to lead Germany into the modern age and pull us through the challenges we’re facing.
F3: You have a good feeling about what voters care about and how to talk to them. Your speech echoes the sentiments that gathered your popularity in the first place - a good start for your campaign. Even the media praises a great reception to your pitch.
A4: Merkel has been a respected leader for these last 16 years, and I will do my best to follow in her path and continue her successful stewardship of our beloved country.
F4: Tying yourself to Merkel might be a good idea, but people liked your more modern policies and are clamoring for change after 16 years. While this attitude is broadly acceptable to many voters, and she did win big several times, this muted pitch seems unlike you.

Q9: The Green party has, for the first time in its history, nominated a chancellor candidate, party leader Robert Habeck. In a development few would have expected four years ago, he appears to be your main contender, selectively polling even with you, while Olaf Scholz of the SPD seems far behind in third place. What’s your strategy regarding your two opponents?
A1: The Green party is always surging a few months before elections and comes crashing down in time, just like in 2011 after Fukushima. I’m not too worried - we should still focus more on competing with the SPD, our traditional opponent.
F1: Maybe you’re onto something, after all, the duopoly of CDU and SPD has held for over 70 years - but dismissing Habeck seems foolish right now, considering the Greens currently poll much higher than at any point in their history. Perhaps you know something the media does not?
A2: I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to act on climate change. Let’s unveil some of our own sensible and realistic environmental policies, piece by piece, to catch media attention away from them and stop their momentum.
F2: By and large, voters trust the Green party more on this issue, but you do have some credibility in talking climate. Your earlier usage of this tactic has received much praise, and is partially responsible for why you’re here now. Just beware of your somewhat climate-suspicious rural base - they still need a reason to vote for you over radical alternatives.
A3: Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for center-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and just attack them moderately where we can.
F3: You’re probably right, but don’t get complacent: you are vying for swing voters with both parties and have lost some ground yourself recently. By keeping conservatives and Merkel-approvers together, you can come up on top by default. You will probably need one of those parties in your coalition though.
A4: Actually, this is a bit ridiculous and reminds me of the publicity stunt the FDP pulled in 2002 when they nominated Guido Westerwelle as chancellor candidate. Let’s mock them for their hubris and don’t refer to Habeck as a legitimate chancellor candidate.
F4: Social media loves your trolling - but considering the polling, this seems petty, even desperate, and is not a good look for you. Habeck gathers sympathy as somewhat of an underdog. Also, the Greens might be an attractive coalition partner for you later on: making fun of them like this won’t make you the friends you need.

Q10: Michael Kretschmer, your party colleague and Minister-President of Saxony, has recently traveled to Moscow and has been criticized for that visit. Additionally, your own trip to Moscow last year is scrutinized by the media as well. What’s your stance on current policies regarding Germany’s relationship with Russia and Putin?
A1: It is important that we don’t demonize Putin and keep our dialogue open. I’m critical of many things the Russian leadership has done, but overall, we should strive to cooperate with them, as we do on the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F1: You are disparagingly called “Putin understander” by some, though especially in East Germany this position is quite popular, and business is relieved. Seeing as how the Union is traditionally more hawkish, some perceive a certain paradigm shift.
A2: I’ve been more lenient in the past, but enough is enough. I will join in with the criticism against Kretschmer and call for a tougher stance towards Putin. Maybe we should only open the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline if we get some concessions from Russia.
F2: Considering your own trip to Moscow last year, this is seen as a wild flip-flop. Many people favor a tougher stance on Russia, but this seems disgustingly opportunistic to many. The CDU is also bitter about you attacking their own politicians, especially the eastern state parties.
A3: Kretschmer is completely right, we have to talk more with Russia, not less. I’m all in favor of more dialogue and stronger economic ties with Russia. Putin is reasonable and can be talked to, as I did last year!
F3: For many, this comes off as too lenient towards Russia. Criticizing the transatlantic partnership isn’t really in line with Union policy, and longtime americanophile Angela Merkel refuses to comment. The silver lining is, the pictures of you next to Putin make you look statesmanlike and might bolster you diplomatic credentials.
A4: This whole thing is overblown, this trip was mostly for cultural exchange. I don’t have much to say about this. We stand on our commitment to Nato.
F4: Calling your own trip just for culture exchange is a blatant lie, for which you get called out. Your commitment to Nato comes to no surprise and doesn’t register. You seem to have stepped on a landmine - hopefully your relationship with Putin will be useful once you’re chancellor.

EQ1: You’re invited to a talk show about immigration and refugees. Although tempers have cooled a bit since 2015, the discussion around Merkel's decision to welcome the refugees 6 years ago is still relevant - particularly for the AfD, who got driven into parliament on this issue in 2017. Germany is still a popular destination for many foreigners seeking a better life, yet the nation does not seem prepared for this. What stance do you take in this debate?
A1: In hindsight, Merkel’s decision seems right to me, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency Frontex.
F1: This is a sensible answer to many - but you have criticized her sharply in 2015, so this is another changed position on your part. As a whole, your comments do satisfy Merkel-loyalists and your conservative base alike, but you better hope the average voter doesn’t catch on. Of course, the left and right are equally pearl clutching at your comments.
A2: There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.
F2: A pragmatic answer - immigration is an often suggested solution to numerous problems, but your Bavarian colleagues and many in your voter base are wary of unintegrated people straining the social safety net. There’s also the issue of certain degrees from Third World countries not being accepted here, so this would have to be dealt with.
A3: Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We’re saying: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.
F3: While a small subset of <i>Gutmenschen</i> are happy about your pivot, this is a road to far for most. You’ve openly criticized Merkel back then, and your base feels betrayed by your opportunistic flip-flop. Your office is swamped by angry calls warning you about another 2015 - and the AfD seems quite welcoming for some of these critics.
A4: On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - 2015 can’t repeat itself.
F4: You reiterate earlier stances you’ve taken - you bring the CSU mindset with you to the national stage. This does get the attention of a good lot of former conservatives that are now in the AfD’s camp: if you can prove you’re serious, they might come back. Your Bavarian predecessor and now Minister of Internal Affairs Horst Seehofer praises your consistency.

Q11: May 2021: A bombshell has rocked the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin has already gone to work on making the law stricter. What is your opinion on this issue?
A1: This was a bad decision by the court. The Climate Protection Act already went far enough and I’m not in favor of hurting the economy with a stricter climate policy. We need to look out for our personal and economic freedoms, fear is not the answer.
F1: The mood in this country is not receptive to statements like this. You get harsh criticism from the Greens and even some in your own party.
A2: I’ve always been an advocate for doing more against climate change. While this has not been mandated by the court, we will also rework our regional Climate Protection Act in Bavaria, to make sure we are doing enough.
F2: You manage to somewhat blunt the advantage the Green party has with this topic, though at the cost of upsetting some conservatives.
A3: We have to become carbon neutral long before 2050. I’m sure the government under Merkel will come up with a sensible solution, which I will continue as chancellor.
F3: A fairly vague answer. You tie yourself to Merkel, but others make more waves with your passivity - the SPD takes this decision as a vindication for its lobbying for stronger climate protections within the coalition.
A4: With the decision by the court, we now have the great opportunity to have an ambitious new Climate Protection Act. Bavaria is on its way to becoming carbon-neutral by 2040, and the whole country should be put on a similar path.
F4: Potential Green voters like this approach - the new Union under Söder really seems to take the climate more seriously. Coalition talks with the Greens now ought to be easier. Your own base is unnerved though; what about all the jobs in traditional industry, and what about the energy prices?

CDU Course-Correction wenn Links
EQ2: Up until now, your campaign has been dominated by a very centrist attitude, tilting center-left even. To many, this seems evocative of Angela Merkel, but some party cadres, particularly around Friedrich Merz, are worried about their core values. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: Yes, I do. Accepting the scientific consensus on climate change and advocating for modern policies is what makes Bavaria so successful - to modernize the whole Union, we have to recalibrate our attitude towards climate action and protecting our social safety net. The CDU/CSU are innovative parties of the 21st century, and I will not let myself get intimidated by right-wing demagogues.
F1: Reasonable - your course so far has been praised, and is part of the reason you even are chancellor candidate. The new Union does get some looks from potential SPD voters and even rural Greens - but the right wing of your party isn’t pleased at all. Your slight against them might make some of them sit it out, or even consider more radical options.
A2: I do not think in ideological categories, I’m simply standing for what I think is good for Germany. The CDU is the party of good governance - not radicalism, both leftist or rightist.
F2: The German people like pragmatism. You could’ve taken a harder ideological stance, but your charismatic attempts to show off a modern Christian Democracy further raise your personal favorability without aggravating anyone. Just keep your base in mind - they do need some red meat from time to time.
A3: I wanted to begin this campaign by bringing us all together - now we can try to tilt the discourse rightwards, taking Merkel supporters with us while framing our conservative positions as more reasonable.
F3: Shrewd, but clever. The Union did mostly unite around you. A certain pivot rightwards is noted by pundits, but you have vacillated heavily between the poles in the past - just beware that your respect from centrist does not falter. Either way, the parties are enthused that you’re a true Christian Democrat at heart!


Q12: More and more people are receiving a Covid vaccine, though not everyone has been granted access yet. Older people and those in critical professions are starting to get the shot, while some who are younger are frustrated to wait. Do you have a comment on how to move forward with the vaccination campaign?
A1: We need to open up quickly for vaccinated people. A return to normalcy has never been so close, and we all had more than enough of lockdowns - not every measure might still be proportionate. Vaccinated people have less risk and thus should receive more benefits.
F1: This comes as a bit of a change of pace to your earlier policies, but your stance has appeal as a good compromise. The majority of people who haven’t had a chance to get vaccinated yet aren’t thrilled though - mostly younger voters. Some also think this might cause a wedge in society, with a certain air of segregation.
A2: We are currently in a very critical phase of the pandemic, a phase in which cohesion could easily be endangered. Vaccinated people should be exempt from some restrictions, but let’s not go overboard. We need to move forward together and be patient until science tells us that it’s safe.
F2: This is a principled take from you, but overall, quite well received by many corners of society. Some, especially from within FDP and AfD, gripe about ongoing lockdowns - I guess you can’t always make everyone happy. This should definitely keep Covid under control though.
A3: It’s important that as many people as possible get vaccinated as quickly as possible so we can overcome this crisis. We have to think of measures to get more people vaccinated, like organizing mobile vaccination teams in supermarkets and ending the priority system.
F3: With the limited supply of vaccines available, experts believe there simply aren’t enough doses to go ahead as broadly as you do. A number of Bavarian doctors also doubt your supermarket-plan to be helpful at all.
A4: The vaccine seems helpful now, but we haven’t had a chance to study its side effects yet. We should be mindful of our bodily health and not be too quick in our judgment - I advocate for a slowdown of the vaccination campaign until we have more information.
F4: This position places you far outside the mainstream - Covid-expert Christian Drosten immediately goes on TV to criticize you, and many of your colleagues distance themselves A certain part of the population calls you their hero - including your own Vice Minister-President Hubert Aiwanger of the minor Free Voters party - but they’re not a big electoral prize. Prepare for a drop in the polls.

Q13: You have been invited to give a speech about German foreign and defense policy. Members of the Bundeswehr stand in the crowd: they eagerly listen to what direction you want Germany to take on the world stage. Which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: For years and years, we have consistently missed the NATO aim to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. I strongly reaffirm our commitment to NATO and this goal! The West has to be united against potential threats.
F1: The audience cheers you on, as spending more on defense is always popular in more conservative circles. Not every potential voter is convinced of this, though.
A2: While I strongly reaffirm our support of a united Alliance and strong defense, I specifically want to call out Robert Habeck. He did not issue a strong endorsement of NATO yet, which is not appropriate for a chancellor.
F2: With how strong the Green Party has been in the polls lately, putting them down a bít could be useful. This is a usual attack against them, but they seem to move right on defense recently - Habeck quickly affirms his support of Nato, and your criticism falls flat.
A3: I want to praise the work we’ve done so far and believe we are in a good spot. While I strongly reaffirm my commitment to NATO, we don’t need to spend more on defense than we do right now; we need to combat waste first and foremost.
F3: This does little to differentiate you from other parties and is softer on defense than the usual position of your party. It does give you some minor wiggle room on fiscal and foreign policy - be sure to make use of it after the election.
A4: NATO is a relic of the cold war. We should stay a member for now, but we should also try to find avenues for cooperating with other nations, keep reaffirming our neutrality, and open up new dialogues with Russia or China, as I did with my visit to Moscow last year.
F4: The crowd is silent, some cough in embarrassment. A few fringe voters might like this statement - everyone else is horrified though, especially your party colleagues. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who got the position of Minister of Defence during her stint as party leader, openly disagrees with your statement. The framing of your Moscow visit even attracts foreign media attention.

EQ3: One salient issue is the topic of pensions, particularly in light of Germany's changing demographics. Currently, pensions are distributed from a fund financed by the current working populace. However, because the number of retirees seems to grow faster than the workforce, the system is thought to be unsustainable. How do you want to address this problem?
A1: The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.
F1: This is a good conservative answer that will motivate your base. <br>This has been the Union's line since its founding, and it does appeal to your older base as well as to young families. That said, this still seems naively passive to some. People also notice how this old-school approach is shared with the AfD.
A2: A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.
F2: An interesting twist that could modernize your image – but keep in mind, your base is worried about economic refugees and integration policies straining the social and fiscal health of the nation, and aren’t stoked about your pivot. Safe to say, the AfD immediately starts churning its fear mongering social media machine.
A3: It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.
F3: Surprisingly leftist! Although the Christian-Social Union is traditionally more economically left-wing than its big sister, your indirect critiques of Merkel rankle some of your colleagues, particularly on your plans to finance this. Your promise to keep the retirement age stable is popular though: hopefully this can fortify your older base and make unexpected inroads.
A4: We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.
F4: This is a broad attractive mix of moderate policies that show your engagement with the topic and unites your base. You avoid criticizing Merkel and offer some innovative solutions – though many fear another raise of the retirement age. To your opponents, this doesn't go far enough, of course.

Q14: June 2021: As the campaign is heating up, you and Robert Habeck are locked in a tense race, with Olaf Scholz in a distant third. However, there does seem to be light on the horizon: The CDU turns out to be the big winner at the provincial elections in Saxony-Anhalt, with Minister-President Reiner Haselhoff’s popularity being credited. What’s your reaction to this information?
A1: I want to congratulate Haseloff for his strong performance. It shows that the citizens still trust the Union to be the best governing party, and we want to emulate his strategy on a national scale.
F1: While his performance was impressive, his strategy was partially built on his incumbency as a “Landesvater”. Still, it might not be a bad message to campaign on good governance, as you’re quite popular in Bavaria yourself. “For a Germany, in which we live well and gladly”, as Merkel advertised 4 years ago.
A2: Haseloff performed very well, but I want to emphasize that the AfD lost votes. When we keep appealing and listening to all people, without prejudice, we can win them back for the democratic parties.
F2: The need to win back AfD voters is definitely something that most parties can agree on - hopefully, your focus on this front can actually yield electoral success. It’s unlikely they’ll exit the parliament, but maybe Haseloff has some good advice.
A3: This was a very strong performance. To show my gratitude, I will make an extra trip to Saxony-Anhalt and campaign with him for some nice pictures.
F3: Haseloff is glad to campaign with you. You definitely show your appreciation of Saxony-Anhalt, and East Germany notices. On your end, you enjoy some local <i> Rotkäppchen</i>-wine and <i>Baumkuchen</i>. An inter-denominational visit to Martin Luther's hometown, the Lutherstadt Wittenberg, rankles few Bavarian catholics and mends fences with the CDU.

EQ4: Attack Robert Habeck
A1: I want to attack the philosopher Habeck on his elitist demeanor. The Greens are led by academics and their policies ignore the concerns of ordinary people. They do not represent the average working-class German!
F1: This attack is one often lobbed at the Greens - although Habeck is quite adept at playing the people-game. His visits, particularly to rural regions, seem to rebuke your allegations of elitism at least partially. Your base is riled up as ever, though.
A2: I want to hit Habeck on remarks he made about me on Twitter - his rants about me are unprofessional, and harmful for our democratic process. Questioning the loyalty to our constitution should be directed at the political extremes, not towards the parties of the democratic center.
F2: As you draw attention to Habecks tweets about “Bavaria as a one-party-state”, the public seems to agree that they are somewhat childish. Some conservative journalists even draw nasty Trump-comparisons. Habeck apologizes to you, and deletes the tweets shortly after.
A3: While Habeck himself seems to be a clean guy, his co-party leader Annalena Baerbock not only fumbled in her CV and plagiarized in her book, she also reported her earning far too late. A party that is led by such careless personalities should not lead Germany!
F3: If Baerbock was the Green candidate, these attacks could go a long way to prove her incompetence. However, now that Habeck is the face of The Greens, people are confused about why you’re focussing on some person in the background. To your opponents, it awfully reeks like sexism, and you’re called out for it.
A4: Let’s stay on message and campaign in a positive way. This campaign isn’t won with attacks, but by convincing people that I am the best choice for chancellor!
F4: People seem to notice somewhat of a gentleman’s agreement between you and Habeck. With both your personal numbers in the positives, many pundits speculate you might make a strong power couple in a potential Black-Green coalition after the election. Just make sure you’re the concertmaster in such an arrangement.

Q15: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbors, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. With all parties unveiling plans to rectify this, what focus do you want to lay?
A1: The pandemic has shown how ill-prepared our schools are. We need to continue improving digital infrastructure in education, through more training, technical assets and a national educational platform. That is what the CDU/CSU has worked on, and will continue doing.
F1: You’re right that this is important, and it’s in line with the current government's strategy - but many blame the CSU in particular for the current misery. Maybe it’s best not to focus on continuing the last 16 years here. Furthermore, some say these measures don’t go far enough, especially the FDP, who have staked out digitalization as their favorite topic.
A2: Actually, we don’t have much to gain by talking about this topic - many voters see us as responsible for the current situation. Let’s downplay it as much as we can and focus on issues where we are seen as more competent, like matters of security or debt.
F2: A fatalistic approach, but a reasonable one. Young voters are disappointed by your lack of a proper position, but better not to fan the flames lest you burn yourself, right? Your CSU Ministers are a bit peeved that you aren’t talking about their purported successes, but even they can read the numbers.
A3: We definitely need to modernize the digital infrastructure of Germany, especially in the public sector. Administrative matters have to be more accessible to citizens, we need to digitize all internal processes and cut down on bureaucracy.
F3: An expected answer, not a bad one - improving the accessibility of Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is popular. However, most parties call for something like this, and this framing of your platform does not generate a lot of attention. The FDP meanwhile drives their strategy on this issue in particular.
A4: Digitalization is a key issue - we need a digital transformation offensive. I want to especially emphasize that we will accomplish a nationwide 5G mobile network by 2025 and provide 15 billion Euros for Gigabit-networks. To that end, we will also establish a Ministry of Digital Innovation and Transformation.
F4: The 5G network is a strong promise that will especially help you in less urban areas, where even 4G coverage can be seen as luxurious in some corners. Your idea of a new Ministry for this topic shows your dedication, but some criticize that digitalization is a cross-sectional task that shouldn't be centralized.

EQ5: One of the more salient issues in the current political landscape across the western world is the question of rents, particularly for younger voters. Most economic and educational opportunities increasingly lie in the big cities of the country - where rent is constantly increasing, to the point where it becomes a serious political question. What is your answer to the housing question?
A1: We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.
F1: A mainstream market-focused answer that will resonate with dozens of families dreaming of an ‘Eigenheim’, particularly in rural regions - the land for new buildings can get quite sparse in the cities. Critics note how Merkel IV hasn’t fulfilled its housing goals during the last 4 years, so hopefully you’re better at keeping promises once you’re chancellor.
A2: We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as they do in NRW. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.
F1: A bit unorthodox for the Union candidate to take such a regulatory approach - but the CSU is traditionally leftwards of the CDU on economics. Many agree something has to be done, and urban and suburban voters appreciate your solutions. It’s also good to mend fences with Laschet’s NRW - even though this policy was introduced by the SPD.
A3: The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a so-called ‘rent moratorium’, where rent would only be able to increase with the inflation rate.
F3: Might I offer you a constitutional law lesson in these trying times? Similar plans in Berlin have been scrapped by the courts recently, to the applause of <i>your</i> CDU colleagues! You’re echoing leftist sentiments - while maybe a few politically uninformed might be swayed, this still makes quite a few conservatives uncomfortable.
A4: We are vehemently against programs like rent controls. Social housing projects have failed to improve the situation - instead we need to support low income renters through housing subsidies. Regulations have to be cut back, we need slimmer bureaucracies and faster approval processes so that the market can sort itself out.
F4: A stringently supply-side answer that’s more expected from an American conservative instead of the Christian Social Union - while some hardliners cheer you on, most centrists, including Merkel’s administration, are a bit estranged from your plans - urban voters even more so.

Q16: July 2021: Catastrophe hits. The meteorological low-pressure area <i>Bernd</i> has hit Central Europe and made several rivers burst over their banks. Disastrous rain and floods are affecting large areas of Germany.  Bavaria is among the affected states and pictures of the destruction in other states dominate the news. You are asked to comment.
A1: The most important thing we can do right now is help the affected regions with their crisis management. They need help now, quickly and unbureaucratically. I’m promising swift support.
F1: A succinct response, though some say that this is the least you can do. Help does get out quickly, and arrives at where it’s needed most, but critics see your response as somewhat passive in the face of the worst flood in Germany since 1962.
A2: This has been an incredible wake-up call of nature. We have to evaluate what we can do to prepare for events like this in the future. For now, helping the victims has the highest priority.
F2: A balanced approach like this is appreciated by most voters. You assure voters concerned about climate change without drawing the issue into the discussion too much. Casting a broad net like this is what people want; be sure to manage the crisis well in your state.
A3: First, we need to quickly and diligently help the affected regions with the cleanup operations. After that, we have to guarantee financial emergency aid for affected people, unequivocally.
F3: At first this quick statement of action is praised by the media, but shortly after, it comes out that your own state government restricted emergency aid for such situations two years ago. Hindsight is 20/20, but the contradictions are still bad press for you.
A4: Extreme weather events are unfortunately going to become more common due to climate change. We have to do a lot more than we are doing now. This might be expensive, but the costs of doing nothing are much, much higher.
F4: The scientific community agrees - it’s good to not let the Green Party be the only ones who connect this to climate change, but this is an argument they have made for years. Focusing attention on this might help them more than you. That said, your environmentalist credentials seem to stay intact for now.

Q17: Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear: 220 fatalities, 186 of those in Germany, the deadliest flood since 1962.<br>Among the mourning, many advisors urge you to get out and show yourself as a man of action, to capitalize on the clean-up efforts.
A1: Actually, I don’t want to be seen as performative. The cleanup operations can be left to professionals, I will keep coordinating the crisis efforts from the state chancellery so that everything goes smoothly - that’s the best I can do for the victims.
F1: Some accuse you of missing in action and your advisors fear you might have missed an opportunity to convince the public of your leadership. That said, caution might be a good way of making sure your state gets through this crisis; quite Merkel-esque of you. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.
A2: Of course, I want to get out there! I have to go in there with the rescue teams; I want to be seen as a man of action, with rubber boots, and shovels and all. Get me some cameras, and some impactful photos with the local fire departments.
F2: While the SPD immediately decries you as copying chancellor Schröder in 2002, there’s no doubt: you simply look good in rubber boots. Your Bavarian base loves the enthusiasm, and your media savvy supplies you with the flair of a folk hero. However, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge as well..
A3: Of course, I want to get out there! But we’re running a national campaign, I want to visit other states as well and show off the competency of my CDU colleagues. Maybe some meetings with Kretschmer in Saxony, Bouffier in Hesse, and especially with my former opponent Laschet in NRW, to mend fences and show that we’re a united front.
F3: The visits start off well, and it turns out German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is coming to NRW, and you and Laschet will be there as well! As he’s starting to talk about the victims though, in the background, Laschet is caught boyishly laughing at some unheard joke. <i>Laschet’s Lacher</i> embarrassingly dominates the headlines for the next few days. At least you’re not in the picture.
A4: Of course, I want to get out there! I have to be a good leader in these times, and part of that is being seen by people. I love my home, and I hate to see my fellow citizens be stripped of their homes. Let’s focus our visits on Bavaria though, to not be seen as too power-hungry. Maybe some interviews with local media, nothing big.
F4: You have some awkward conversations, but overall, the visits go well and people appreciate being heard. You seem a bit invisible, although softening your bombastic image could be appealing to some. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.

Q18: Climate change is a much-discussed topic again after the floods - it seems dire warnings of extreme weather events are starting to come true. In the wake of this, you have been asked if this had an impact on your stance on how to best combat climate change.
A1: The floods have shown that we need to be much more ambitious than before. One of the worst offenders is our energy production: we need to stop using coal for energy generation by 2030 and seek out new innovative technologies to keep energy affordable.
F1: This is consistent with what you’ve said in the past, and your leftwards course on climate really seems to have vindicated itself. That, however, does not make this more palatable to coal-producing regions, and catches significant criticism from some economical organizations usually associated with your party.
A2: Climate change is coming, whether we want it or not. The most important thing we can do is mitigate its worst effects to prevent catastrophes like this from doing too much damage - we need better crisis responses. Climate action is necessary, as long as it doesn't stifle our economy and freedom of living
F2: It’s kind of odd for you to pivot rightwards on climate change - perhaps you fear your conservative base might abandon you? Coal-producing regions are happy, and certain colleagues are as well - most polls show that the Germans liked your older, more ambitious stance though.
A3: Why get head over heels with a statement? Let’s wait until Habeck says something, then respond to him in co-opting the more popular parts of his program, while criticizing bans and other incursions into people’s personal lives. We know what polls well and what doesn’t, let’s use that to our advantage!
F3: The media seems to slowly catch on to your tactics - but the average voter just doesn’t care. While this is undoubtedly still a Green topic, and they are immediately jumping to defuse your criticism, voters see you as the overall voice of reason in this discourse.
A4: We are in an energy crisis - we need renewable energies, clearly. However, if you want to take climate change seriously, you have to agree: we are reliant on nuclear power. Exiting now would be foolish. We’re risking blackouts and the loss of jobs.
F4: Nuclear power is a controversial topic among the Germans. You might be right that nuclear energy could help with climate measures, but many see the exit as a settled issue. It doesn’t help that the decision to continue the phase-out was made by Merkel after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, and you supported it.

Q19: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. Some media figures are now going as far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory. What do you think of this?
A1: We need a long term strategy for Covid, but a universal vaccine mandate might not be doable constitutionally. Maybe a sort of staggered plan for group-based vaccine mandates could lead us to our goal. Certain institutions that have entered a duty to serve this country.
F1: You’re echoing the mainstream, a vast majority of Germans approve of this stance. A proposal similar to yours gains crosspartisan traction and is poised to pass in the coming months.
A2: While I wouldn’t go that far, as we might run into legal issues, we should give people more incentives to get vaccinated. One solution might be to open up certain establishments from the lockdown, but only for vaccinated and recovered people.
F2: This statement is received quite well overall and might actually make vaccinations more attractive. Skeptics still feel alienated - better hope they’ll return from the fringes soon.
A3: Covid is basically over, the case numbers are very low. One has to be honest and ask: Do we even need such an expensive program? Vaccines are good to have, but we should focus on opening up and treating Covid as the non-problem it has become.
F3: Some from the <i> Querdenker</i>-anti-vax-movement are surprised by your pivot towards them - your Vice Minister President Hubert Aiwanger strongly praises your stance. For anyone else though, this is a big gaffe - and you change your course back shortly after. The damage is done, people think you can’t keep a consistent stance.
A4: We need a vaccine mandate, as soon as possible. A partial mandate is not enough - Germany is the Covid problem child of Germany. At the end of the day, we have to have a long term strategy, and that heavily involves vaccinations.
F4: You’re known as a consistent hardliner against covid and somewhat of a collectivist - but compulsory vaccinations are generally unpopular, and some question if such a move is even legal constitutionally. You keep up the image of a strong Covid-fighter, but how long can that be electorally fruitful?

Q20: August 2020: With the campaign heating up, there have been some attacks on you and your party - a big target is CSU Minister of Transportation Andreas Scheuer. The CSU had promised a “Maut”, highway tolls for foreigners, but the project failed spectacularly and might cost millions of Euros still, due to interference from the EU courts. Scheuer was widely blamed for the whole affair. As party leader, you’re asked: what went wrong?
A1: I mean, in the end, the whole thing with the Maut just went horribly wrong, and was a real problem. That’s just a pity. It wasn’t a sole CSU or Scheuer-project though!
F1: While you address the misgivings of this project, to many your apology seems kind of childish. Your attempts to shift the blame also don’t go over well.
A2: Actually, the project only failed because the EU sabotaged it. We need accountability from the European community, and carefully reevaluate our relationship and contributions.
F2: While you might appeal to some AfD voters this way, euroscepticism doesn’t play well in Germany right now. Your attempts to shift the blame fail, and you’re attacked harshly by the other parties.
A3: Andi really screwed this up - we have to drop him. I’ll publicly criticize him for his incompetence and make it clear there will be no political post for him in my government. When being asked if he should resign, we’ll defer to the parliamentary investigation committee.
F3: The opposition has long called on you to drop your support - and finally came through to you, it seems. Scheuer has to resign. Maybe cutting your losses is worth it: this affair still doesn’t reflect great on the CSU as a whole, though.
A4: It’s true that we didn’t manage to get the highway toll through during the last four years - but it’s clear that our highways are still too overcrowded. With me as chancellor, I promise that we will get a Maut done in the next four years!
F4: Are you sure? It’s been 4 years of nothing but negative press about this project; barely anyone supports it anymore. This promise doesn’t resonate with a lot of voters, and “Söder doubles down on Maut” isn’t a great headline for you.

EQ6: A bit of a minor issue, but one that has gripped the imagination of many young voters is the topic of cannabis. Currently, it is a controlled substance, and illegal to produce, distribute or own. In light of worldwide movements to decriminalize or even legalize it: <i>Wann Bubatz legal</i>?
A1: Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.
F1: This took a turn! This is a hard change in pace for your party, who has advocated for a “drug free society” ever since its founding. You receive a plethora of angry calls from the CSU party apparatus and conservative voters in your home state - but other corners might be more receptive to such a pivot.
A2: We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.
F2: “Cannabis is no broccoli” as drug commissioner Daniela Bär succinctly said. The Union’s line remains unchanged even in the face of developing popular opinions. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - legalization is still very controversial, and concerned parents are happy to have someone on their side.
A3: Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.
F3: Have you indulged yourself? To your party, it sounds like it: they take you aside to talk it over, clearly annoyed by your contradictory outburst. It leaks into the media, and you’re publicly humiliated. Regardless of personal opinions, you’ve offended most of your voters for little gain and are forced to accept the restrictive party line in the end.
A4: Not at all: we need to further pursue drug users and lower the amount of cannabis that is legally prosecuted. Our goal is a drug free society. Look at the Netherlands, they have decriminalized the possession of just 5 grams, with fatal consequences - that won’t happen to our children.
F4: The cannabis question hasn’t been a particularly salient issue before, but by drawing the battle lines this clearly, you’ve dragged it into a certain limelight. The Greens and SPD vehemently oppose your harsh stance, and in the verbal conflict, it’s unclear who will profit. Better hope older voters are still as reliable in turnout.


Q21: There are 7 parties poised to enter parliament, and none has ever won an absolute majority since Adenauer in 1957. As such, it is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. You are asked ad-nauseam - who would you enter a coalition with?
A1: We will talk with all democratic parties - the SPD, the Greens and the FDP. However, I want to needle the leftist parties for not ruling out a coalition with the extremist Left. They are fringe populists, unfit to govern.
F1: This is your expected answer. The public seems to be on your side - a narrow plurality of people in polls seem to want Scholz and Baerbock to disavow the idea of Red-Red-Green, which they refuse to do. It seems redbaiting still works, 21 years after the end of the DDR.
A2: We rule out coalitions with the extremes. Normally we would talk with everyone in the center, but it’s clear how a continuation of the Grand Coalition of the last 8 years would not have a public mandate. We need to find a different governing majority: I’d prefer Black-Green, or a Jamaica Coalition with the Greens and FDP.
F2: Some question if the Union and SPD will even have a majority. Such a blanket statement leaves you with few options later on: let’s hope the Greens and FDP are ready for another try at Jamaica. Or, if you’re lucky, you might only need Habeck: there’s certainly been a lot of speculation about both of you governing together, and many people are on board.
A3: The last few years have shown how we can not ignore the 10-15% of the populace voting for the AfD. This country needs change and new solutions. I think a Bahamas coalition with the AfD and the FDP could work - our neighbor Austria showed us how the right wing can govern harmonically.
F3: This goes against everything thought to be certain - the firewall against the right has been broken down. Your stance is poison to most voters, SPD and Greens rule you out as chancellor in return, and even the FDP might be a hard sell now. The AfD is tempted by the prospect of power, but you’re a dubious personality to them.
A4: Jamaica, Bahamas… All these coalition names make me want to take a holiday in the Caribbean.
F4: Your Bavarian supporters are outraged that you would prefer the sea to the mountains. <br> Spaß beiseite, Markus! Concentrate; in this mod, there is no funny ending where you go to the Caribbean!

EQ7: EQ7: A defining social issue is the question of abortion. Currently, criminal law §218 disallows abortions generally, but decriminalizes them in case of rape, or if the pregnancy is under 12 weeks old. Additionally, §219a establishes an “ad ban” for doctors offering abortions. You’re asked for your stance on this controversial topic.
A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: How unexpected! Some journalists praise you for your forward thinking and your genuinely progressive outlook - but your party is very unhappy. Many of your colleagues and friends seem shocked - While there are some who can see how §219a might be harmful, most don’t want to see you trivialize the right of the unborn like that.
A2: We want to strike $218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: There have been certain CDU politicians advocating against §218 all the way back in the ‘90s, people like Rita Süssmuth. They, however, have been repeatedly repudiated - and the same now happens to you. After you publicly have to elaborate your stance as a “third way” and reiterate personal moral objections, you’re in an awkward spotlight, and a minor crisis in your own state government ensues.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: This is a fine answer that doesn’t make this a bigger issue than it is. Standing by classic conservative moralism and Merkel’s policies here is expected and applauded by family advocacy groups. Let’s focus your campaign on topics that matter more.
A4: The right to life does not stand to disposition. The unborn child has a right to live, and we stand vehemently against efforts to trivialize or encourage abortions from the state. Instead, adoption procedures should be simplified - while doctors who do not report abortions have to incur noticeable sanctions.
F4: Moral issues really weren’t at the forefront of this campaign, but your strong answer has taken the attention of the political landscape. Some of your language is taken straight from the AfD, and women's groups vehemently denounce you. They’ll probably go to Habeck anyways, so let’s hope there’s a silent majority for your stance.

Q22: September 2021: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. Many loyal locals are left behind, as the Taliban are poised to make a comeback. The government is sharply criticized for its botched evacuation - what stance do you want to take?
A1: Afghanistan is the biggest blowback for the West since Vietnam. Of course, our government does not shed a good light, and the EU is too speechless - we quickly need a unified European position now. The USA has the main responsibility here, that’s where the decision for this retreat was made. We need a NATO-Special Session.
F1: Many see your analysis as correct, as the USA’s retreat was the deciding factor in this situation. It’s questionable though how much you can actually do about this as chancellor, and while the criticisms of Merkel's administration track with popular opinion, some insiders are rankled at your distancing.
A2: It’s a disgrace how so many good people would now have to live under civil strife and a possible Taliban takeover. We at least have to take in those who cooperated with our troops - we owe it to them for their service. We should also further support the UN refugee agency financially.
F2: You’ve been critical of refugees in the past - this is a change in directions, similar to the one Merkel had in 2015. Some smell opportunism in the air. The AfD immediately derides you as no better than the chancellor and you receive angry calls from some local supporters, one of which is your own predecessor and Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer.
A3: A big part of those responsible in our government should not keep their positions after the election. Specifically, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD is clearly to blame the most. Just saying “Sorry, we misjudged” does not suffice! He should have started the evacuations much earlier, and there should be direct repercussions for his position.
F3: There’s some truth to that, though the SPD retorts by blaming the CDU-led Defence Ministry. Your charisma carries you over the hump in this fight, but the media does not appreciate you rattling on Merkel's cabinet so shortly before the election - meanwhile, the Greens get off scot-free.
A4: We can’t have a repeat of the refugee crisis of 2015. We need to take in some refugees, yes, but more clearly, we need to accept that there have to be upper limits and contingents for immigration  – we can not safe the whole world. We need to massively limit the fallout of this situation by securing our borders.
F4: Ouch - a classic CSU-line. You really stand by your 2015 position here, to capture a silent majority and take from the AfD’s appeal. You’re of course immediately jumped upon by left-wingers - but your base cheers you on, and your predecessor, Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, concurs with you. Hopefully this pays off.

Q23: September 2021: Official TV debates are a relatively recent phenomenon in Germany, only being consistently organized since 2002. Now, for the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Olaf Scholz and Annalena Baerbock are all invited. What is going to be your strategy?
A1: Olaf Scholz is struggling in the polls, but he’s still our main competitor for a lot of voters with his wannabe-Merkel attitude. It seems foolish to do anything but attack him on his many weaknesses.
F1: Perhaps his position is stronger than the polls suggest - and someone has to sweep up the median voter. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - Let’s hope you can make it count.
A2: Habeck is a strong candidate, and my main opponent for the chancellorship. But he isn’t invulnerable - and with the right tone, we could sweep some of his voters right from under his feet. Let’s focus on him.
F2: Four years ago, few would have expected a minor party like the Greens having a serious shot at the chancellorship. Time to knock them down a peg. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - Let’s hope you can make it count.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America.
F3: You have an imposing stature, a great rhetorical talent and charisma - adding concreteness and optimism to the mix might be a winning strategy. Let’s hope taking the high road helps to close the lid on this election!
A4: Actually, I don’t want two left-wing politicians to gang up on me. This format is not up to the times and I can guarantee, time will not be allotted fairly to the only conservative party at the table. Thus, I must decline this invitation.
F4: Many question your judgment. The debate goes ahead without you - and makes it look like Greens and SPD compete for the chancellery, with the CDU/CSU as a petty third wheel. Habeck and Scholz seem to tie, but the real loser by default is Markus Söder.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form this coalition after the election?
F1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form a coalition with populist demagogues after the election?
F1: Scholz is in a bit of an awkward spot with this attack and doesn’t can’t give a clear answer. While Habeck doesn’t either, he slips a bit under the radar. Overall, you and Habeck tie the debate, as Scholz’s intrusions into the political center are squashed.
A2: Let’s hit him on his scandals as finance minister. Under his watch, Wirecard collapsed due to fraudulent dealings and lots of people lost their money. We need to poke attention to the police raid on a government office belonging to his ministry - he refuses to take responsibility.
F2: A damaging attack, but he hits back by mentioning the corruption in your party - the CSU is currently associated with a lot of shady deals. The debate gets ugly, you are taken aback, Scholz seemingly can’t remember details of his meetings - in the end, Habeck manages to get out relatively unscathed, with his authentic demeanor winning him the day.
A3: Scholz likes to pretend he’s a moderate, but the program of his party is very leftwing, especially regarding pensions and the minimum wage. It shows that the SPD as a whole is unfit to govern, and a symbol of past days.
F3: You might have had an opening there, but keep in mind, Scholz is still Merkel’s Vice Chancellor. Mentioning his policies makes many people notice the SPD’s agenda once more, and they don’t seem that unpopular. Habeck doesn’t really latch onto the critique, seeing him as not much of a threat - but with his numbers going up in the next few days, it seems both of you underestimated him.
A4:  Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a populist to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the CSU’s record in government. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s unlikely winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q25: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Robert Habeck, chancellor candidate of the Green party. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: Robert Habeck lacks the character to be chancellor. His background is elitist and unrelatable, he goes on childish rants on twitter and he egregiously pushed away his female co-party chair from the top-post.
F1: Your attacks on his character fall flat. You seem scary and imposing, but Habeck is genuinely liked by many people, and most have been clamoring for a more policy-focused debate. Habeck and Scholz condemn your attempts at slandering him and bring it back to the issues. Your performance is criticized sharply.
A2: Everyone on this stage agrees that something has to be done about climate change, but what Mr Habeck and his party want can’t be the solution! Don’t get it wrong: you have to be affluent to vote Green. I am worried that Germany would lose jobs and fall behind under a chancellor Habeck - the CDU/CSU is the true party of the environment.
F2: You gamble that you can win this election on the Greens very own turf. Indeed, you have credibility when talking about the climate - Habeck seems to have difficulties communicating his priorities and gets impatient, while you’re coming off as the voice of reason. Scholz can’t even interject. Surprisingly, voters actually see you as most persuasive.
A3: I’ll attack him for his willingness to govern with the radical Left party. Moderates should be frightened by this prospect, there should be a firewall against Radicals of all stripes, and entertaining a coalition with the Left, as the Greens do, is irresponsible.
F3: That is a weak point for him, but most voters frightened by this prospect are already in your camp. That said, you throw an unwanted leftism on Habecks image. He seems unable to respond properly, and while Scholz has a similar problem, you ignore each other mostly, landing in a tie. The duopoly reasserted itself, at least in the Triell.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a populist to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the CSU’s record in government. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s unlikely winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q26: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the CDU/CSU programs, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: The CSU is the party of climate action - we founded the first environmental protection Ministry in all of Germany, in 1970. We need a new push in talking climate, moving away from coal and towards regenerative energy with a concrete plan of action - I have the economic competence to lead us through this crisis without tempo limits or flight bans.
F1: Habeck criticizes you sharply on the details of your policies, but you do have more executive experience than him - and advocating for climate policies while decrying bans on personal freedoms is a topic you’re comfortable at. Habeck is unable to get a good retort, Scholz doesn’t even register - meanwhile voters like your idealism and optimism, and you come out as the Triells winner.
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason. We’re not in an ideological bubble - politics need to take care of the political center. We need a strong state when talking about security, and a liberal and worldly state when talking about the people’s quality of life. This is the compass to the future.
F2: Your pitch isn’t all bad, considering you are the centrist in this debate - but their arguments about the CSU’s costly proposals of the past, like the Maut, are hard for you to refute. Your generic pitch seems muted in contrast to your opponents visions for change - overall, Scholz manages to walk this tightrope the most competent in his performance.
A3: Bavaria is the most successful state in Germany. We have low unemployment and offer good opportunities. Bavaria works - I will do the same to Germany. My administration will both be a continuity of the efficiency of the Merkel years and a new start.
F3: You are popular in Bavaria, and this pitch helps you in Germany’s 2nd most populous state - but historically, the CSU’s regionalism hasn’t been popular federally. Mentioning Merkel helps, but while Habeck proceeds to poke holes in your presentation of Bavaria, Scholz provides a more impressive defense of Social Democracy in the aura of a statesman.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. We have enough ammunition to show Habecks and Scholz’ incompetence, and I shouldn’t be afraid to use it. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: Your attacks on Green ideology and Scholz’ wirecard dealings are vicious, and your impressive stature makes you seem scary to the average viewer. <i>Die Bild</i> title page reads <i>Terror-Shrek</i> with a picture of you in your carnival-Shrek-costume. In such a climate, Scholz’s calm attitude really caught on, unfortunately.
EQ8: Along with the <i> Triell </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i> Vierkampf </i>. While the Greens have seemingly eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Paul Ziemiak of the CDU (since the CSU is heading the Union ticket through you), debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – unfortunately, this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, counter to prior hopes.
A2: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If the FDP matches or surpasses their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Paul Ziemiak  made a strong case for the Union’s policies and for you as the pragmatic heir to the Merkel era - reaffirming the CDU’s loyalty to you.
A4: Let's hope Ziemiak gets me some good headlines.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…

Q27: The 26th of September is almost here. Finally, this historically important campaign is coming to an end. Hopefully, your ambitions of becoming Germany’s first Bavarian chancellor can finally come to fruition! In your final lap for this year, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the CDU/CSU has a clear profile, and I’m proud to stand with him for our values!
F1: Merz dutifully rallies your rural conservative base and excites them for another victory. You show yourself to be a true Christian-Democrat and reassure your right flank. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: Who else but Chancellor Angela Merkel could be the right person? She is a figure larger than life, an electoral juggernaut who has won the last four contests, and I want to show people that I’m the one to build on her legacy.
F2: The outgoing chancellor herself is still popular, and you unite your party while making a believable pitch for centrists - with her last hurrah, she issues you a solid endorsement. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A3: No matter what happens, we have to make sure the right-wing demagogues do not increase their vote shares. I’m worried about the AfD taking first place in some East German states, and direct mandates could go to them: I need to campaign broadly in the New States, with local colleagues like Haseloff and Kretschmer.
F3: The firewall against the right wing is defended in the east, it seems. Your eastern colleagues were among your earliest supporters, and your strict migration policies could prove useful here. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A4: Armin Laschet, party leader of the CDU and my past rival, could help me mobilize voters in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state. I want to burry the hatched and show how the Union is united to win this election once again!
F4: Laschet is a bit of a hot potato, given his past gaffes. He’s also still somewhat bitter about the way you upstaged him - and can only find enough time for one last event with you, to unite the CDU/CSU. Now, it’s time now to return to your home of Nürnberg, and hope that your pitch to the voters wins out; “So Germany Stays Stable”.

Q7: You and Armin Laschet both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU, in an intra-party competition not seen since 2002. Back then, your predecessor Stoiber won out against Merkel, but lost in the general election. These days, while Laschet has the bully pulpit as leader of the national party, popular opinion polls show you ahead. How do you want to go about settling this?
A1: Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.
F1: It seems like you’ve made some new friends over the last few days. Laschets leadership certainly seemed to have raised some eyebrows: after the state parties of Berlin, Lower Saxony and Baden-Württemberg speak out in your favor, you triumph - the presidium actually finds a narrow majority for you! Laschet is humiliated, and has no choice but to accept you as the Unions candidate: “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.
F2: After days of pressure from some influential people, and seeing the numbers himself, Laschet eventually withdraws his candidacy, with a strong endorsement for you. The way forwards is clear - the chancellor candidacy is yours. However, your aggressive push left a sour taste in the mouth of some colleagues, and you might have to mend some rifts in order to get your campaign going: “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F3: While you present a solid argument, and do get crossparty support, Laschet’s leadership-bonus just seemed too much to overcome after all. He turns out to be the narrow winner in an extremely close contest, and in the end, you concede, deflated. While your respectable showing was still a demonstration of your power, there’s no way around it: you lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F4: The vote is decisive - in the end, your gamble seemed to work flawlessly. With many MP’s fearing to get smothered with Laschet as a candidate, you come out as a clear winner. The CDU leader accepts the vote and steps aside in your favor, giving you the spotlight. While this whole ordeal spent a lot of resources, the party seems to unequivocally unite around your candidacy: “So Germany stays stable”.


Q29: You and Armin Laschet both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU, in an intra-party competition not seen since 2002. Back then, your predecessor Stoiber won out against Merkel, but lost in the general election. These days, while Laschet has the bully pulpit as leader of the national party, popular opinion polls show you ahead. How do you want to go about settling this?
A1: Now, it’s time for payoff. I’m sure Laschet will try to force a vote by the party elites - I’m going to welcome this, he’ll be surprised by how much support I have even among them. If even the upper CDU echelons stand with me against him, there will be nothing in my way.
F1: Unfortunately, the party elites are still on the CDU leader’s side after all. Through the influence of people like Wolfgang Schäuble and Volker Bouffier, Armin Laschet prevails and is declared to be the next chancellor candidate for the Union. You swiftly accept the result, but your audacity damaged your standing in the party. There’s no way around it: You lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A2: During the next few days, I will hammer my main argument again and again - I have the better polling numbers, and I’m the one who can lead the CDU/CSU to victory in the fall. I   will showcase several district candidates who are already distancing themselves from Laschet. He would lose, him and the rest of the party have to accept this.
F2: You hammer away - but your pleas fall on deaf ears. While the CSU still supports you, a failure to reach out to the CDU seems to have emboldened Laschet with a stable base of support among the party apparatus. Many of them regard you as an opportunistic paper tiger - without a clearer plan of action, your gambit falters, and you’re firmly asked to support Armin Laschet as the Union candidate. There’s no way around it: you lost to his pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F3: While you present a solid argument, and do get crossparty support, it turns out that your grandstanding has alienated quite a lot MP’s as well. Laschet turns out to be the clear winner in the contest, and you have no choice but to accept a clear result. While you’re still regarded well in Bavaria, there’s no way around it: you lost to Armin's pitch, “Making Germany Together”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. They want to get reelected - with my strong numbers, I’m confident they’ll see me as the better option and pick me over Laschet.
F4: The vote is close - but in the end, your gamble seems to work. With enough MP’s fearing to get smothered with Laschet as a candidate, you very narrowly come out as the winner. The CDU leader accepts the vote and reluctantly steps aside in your favor, pleading for a united Union. While this whole ordeal spent a lot of resources, the party seems to slowly unite around your candidacy: “So Germany stays stable”.


CDU Course-Correction wenn Mitte
EQ8: Up until now, your campaign has embraced a classical moderate-conservative Christian Democracy, mostly following the center-right party doctrine. Some advisors want you to pivot further left towards the median voter, while others want you to take the AfD’s wind out of their sails. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand by my moderate credentials, I am a proud Christian Democrat. However, we are competing with two left-wing alternatives: in order to win a strong mandate, we need to return to some of my leftwing pivots from the past - they are what brought me success.
F1: A classic electoral tactic. Your pivot back to the left is noted by the media - although this time, the opportunism is smelled from miles away. Of course, centrists are still enamored with your past stances on climate change, but there are some scathing critiques out there that throw oil on the flames of Habecks and Scholz’ criticisms on your person.
A2: The CDU/CSU are the parties of the center. We have done a great job at governing over the last 16 years, and while we need to move into the future, our future is a Christian-Democratic one. I stand by my course.
F2: Giving nods to each side of the aisle keeps your party united and conflict-free. This is always helpful for the perception of your competency. This gives you more breathing room to campaign in a balanced manner.
A3: Friedrich Merz has tapped into a surprisingly large voter potential in 2018: Merkel-sceptic conservatives. The chancellor has become popular with voters of the other parties - for us, some of her policies are a bit more controversial. On these issues, we definitely need to move rightwards - to provide for a real alternative to the Greens and SPD.
F3: The word “alternative” isn’t lost to your advisors, and your pivot isn’t wholly out of character for you while solidifying your right flank. The fact that you have less competition on this side of the spectrum might have you coming out in first place by default - but there are still grumblings about the distance you’re taking from Merkel.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Rechts
EQ9: Up until now, your campaign has been met with a surprisingly hardline-conservative tone,  seemingly wanting to take the party rightwards, quite evocative of the typical CSU rhetoric during Merkel. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand for what I think is right, but it’s become clear to me we need to defuse ourselves. Let’s reconcile with the CDU and Merkel - so that their supporters won’t defect to the Liberals, or even our opponents.
F1: It’s true that your efforts have radically changed popular opinion around you for the worse, and adjusting your course could prevent some defections- but you risk coming off as a political chameleon without principles. Mending fences with Merkel however should take priority now, you’re still trying to follow in her footsteps.
A2: Yes. I stand for what I believe is right in this country, and it’s clear how we need a change in attitude in Germany to stay competitive. Our standing in the world is decreasing, and we need to work towards improving our country to be the best it can be, because we are patriots.
F2: Patriotism has been a dodgy topic in Germany since the end of the war - but not in Bavaria. When you hold a speech the next day echoing your stance, you energize your supporters, turn some heads in the AfD and reap the approval of both your party and the CDU’s eastern state parties. Some are a bit irritated by your grandstanding, but overall, you sell the line.
A3: Look - chancellor Merkel is a competent woman who I respect. But the fact of the matter is, her policies have tilted leftwards, both socially and economically. What our country needs in the post-Merkel era are policies more in line with conservative doctrines - the AfD’s success has shown that. If anything, we need to come back to our roots and move this country to the right.
F3: Your biting ideological stance as well as your outright Merkel critiques leak out to the press and dominate the headlines for a few days - this is bad for unity among the Union parties. Some CDU politicians noticeably shoot back - and shrewdly, Habeck and Scholz find strangely reconciliatory words with the chancellor over the next few days.

A4: While the results in Saxony-Anhalt are definitely praiseworthy, me and my surrogates should focus on my main contender, Robert Habeck. We’re running a national campaign - and directly dealing with our opponent might be better.
F4: You keep the attention on Habeck and his issue - finally a asmall break in the Greens unlikely surge. That said, you could also push voters away from your own successes - depending on how you frame your attacks.
