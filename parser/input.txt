Q66: The Alternative für Deutschland (AfD, “Alternative For Germany”) has grown rapidly since its founding in 2013. Originally a eurosceptic party, they were swept into parliament four years ago as a reaction to 2015, concurrent with nationalist backlashes all over Europe. Many people are toxic towards the new party, earnestly comparing them to the Nazi-movement, but others, especially East Germans, feel drawn to them nonetheless. As the Union’s candidate, how do you plan to win them back?
A1: The AfD found its success primarily on the back of our parties veering leftwards under Merkel. By taking their concerns seriously and pivoting back rightward on social and economical issues, we can position ourselves as the only electable conservative option for the right wing.
F1: This is the argument that many members of the “Werte-Union” make. Your stance could be successful on the fringes of moderate AfD voters, but that wing of the party is quickly dying in favor of the more hardline, populist “Flügel”, primarily made up of former non-voters - legitimizing their points rhetorically might actually help them in the end.
A2: It’s a populist movement. Who voted for Hitler? Right, the jobless. These people feel like the system has failed them personally, so they turn away from it. By producing good policies, creating jobs and furthering our prosperity we can restore the trust in the economic and individual potential of Germany, and thus, relegitimize our system.
F2: This rhetoric doesn’t make much waves and is of moderate success. There’s simply not much you could do about this before the election. Your stance might prove useful in the long run though - if you’re serious. Keep in mind many of their voters tend to belong to lower classes, so the wealth has to trickle down to them.
A3: Helmut Kohl was a great man, but privately, we have to admit, the reunification of Germany has failed in many parts. We need a new culture of respect towards East Germany, to show presence and listen to them, to get more East German politicians into the limelight. That way, we’ll take the AfD’s base right from under their feet.
F3: With many visits in the “new States” and a renewed focus on your East German state parties, your strategy receives moderate success! While it will take much more than that to knock the AfD out, your polling in East Germany improves, at the cost of both them and even a few “ostalgic” Left voters.
A4: This semi-fascist party likes to complain, but they have no answers themselves. We need to vehemently denounce their xenophobic, even antisemitic tendencies, while showing off just how hollow their program is. We won’t stoop down to their level and compromise our values. They don’t want to do politics, they want to destroy democracy.
F4: The moral high ground, indeed. While it keeps the AfD from expanding further into your base, and upholds your unwavering firewall against the Right, attacking them doesn’t really convince any of their current voters. They know about the hollowness of their policies, they’re just too frustrated to care. In fact, the Far Right just seems to be more energized.

OPPORTUNISMUSFRAGE

Q1: You’ve always been known for your particular style of populism. While admirers are calling it pragmatic, critics are calling it self serving, unprincipled and cynical. During your career in Bavaria, you certainly knew how to play the power game, but now, on the big stage, the matter has become somewhat of an issue, with some viewing you as somewhat of a greasy salesman.

Wenn Opportunismus über 15:
A1: <i>May 2012</i>: “Islam has also become a part of Bavaria”. </br><i>April 2018</i>: “Islam does not contribute to the identity and culture of our country”.
F1: Any way the wind blows - and that wind smells like the stinky whiff of unprincipled politicians. You seem to have overdone it with your gambles: your formerly sympathetic image has transformed to that of a ruthless brute, wrestling its way to Berlin. People are starting to have enough of you playing with their democracy as if it was a dollhouse.

Wenn Opportunismus zwischen 10 und 15:
A1: <i>December 2020</i>: “I think Black-Green has a lot of appeal, because both political forces are looking at the big questions of our time.”</br><i>Februrary 2021</i>: “Bavaria is a green country without Greens in office. And I think it can stay that way.”
F1: People unfortunately seem to catch on to your constant vacillations. Especially when talking about your fellow political players, you seem to dish out compliments and criticism how it pleases you. Some are calling you a “smarter Trump” - but given how unpopular the former American president is in Germany, it’s not a badge of honor.

Wenn Opportunismus zwischen 5 und 10:
A1: <i>June 2010</i>: “If you take the climate seriously, you know, we need nuclear power:” </br><i>May 2011</i>: “I am happy [about the exit from nuclear], because it was my proposal and that of my party.”
F1: People are still giving you the benefit of the doubt about your oftentimes contradicting statements and constantly developing opinions - but you aren’t immune to being criticized on your flip flops. On some issues it’s understandable (even Merkel changed her mind about nuclear), but Habeck and Scholz manage to look more trustworthy than you, overall.

Wenn Opportunismus unter 5:
Q1: You’ve always been known for your particular style of populism. Not too long ago, you were known to be a cunning opportunist: however, over the course of the campaign, journalists have instead noticed a personal, but pretty consistent ideology behind your style of politics. It’s not just them - polls show that people actually regard you as trustworthy and sympathetic, particularly because of your wittiness.

A1: All of life is a big compromise, starting with marriage, ending with politics. (<i>December 2020</i>)
F1: Lucky you - containing your predatory instincts as a politician seems to have paid dividends. For centrists, you certainly have a lot of appeal - providing you with the electoral coalition that rewarded Merkel with 4 victories before.
A2: You know what the best thing about Berlin is? The way back to Bavaria. (<i>December 2018</i>)
F2: Lucky you - containing your predatory instincts as a politician seems to have paid dividends. The love of your home, Bavaria, doesn’t just make you seem principled and warm, it’s also reciprocated. The Free State is certainly fired up for a chancellor from their ranks.
A3: If you know the “Lord of the Rings” saga, where would the AfD be? They’d feel right at home in Mordor. That’s where they’d belong. (<i>February 2021</i>)
F3: Lucky you - containing your predatory instincts as a politician seems to have paid dividends. Even though you were accused of electorally fishing on the far right in the past, your steadfast stance against the AfD really seems credible recently. This lessens the opposition from the cultural left, which could be crucial for casting a broad net.
A4: Endangered species are exempt from hunting season until they have recovered, that’s why I won’t mention the SPD. (<i>September 2018</i>)
F4: Lucky you - containing your predatory instincts as a politician seems to have paid dividends. You and Robert Habeck dominate the political landscape - it’s a battle of the folksy, fatherly statesmen. Olaf Scholz, with his comparatively boring demeanor, seldom gets to interject - which could open up a new voter block of Social Democratic centrists for you.

F2: You keep unwavering in your pivot on refugees. Your party isn’t fully on board, especially your former mentor Horst Seehofer, who gives you an angry call. The AfD salivates at rural voters frightened of your newfound love for asylum seekers - but you keep building rapport with more culturally cosmopolitanist people. Maybe an overture for Black-Green?

We need to massively limit the fallout of this situation by securing our borders.
F4: After your surprisingly positive statements about refugees earlier in the campaign, your backtrack is quickly noted by the media and viewed as tasteless in the wake of a coming Taliban takeover.

A1: We need to open up quickly for vaccinated people. A return to normalcy has never been so close, and we all had more than enough of lockdowns - not every measure might still be proportionate. Vaccinated people have less risk and thus should receive more benefits.
F1: Even though you’ve been a hardliner in the past, you’ve since changed your mind, it seems. Your stance isn’t unpopular, but the majority of people who haven’t had a chance to get vaccinated yet aren’t thrilled - mostly younger voters. Some also think this might cause a wedge in society, with a certain air of segregation.

A2: In Bavaria, we are deciding to be on the safe side, consciously. Of course, freedom will only be possible through vaccinations - but I’m particularly worried about these mutations. Opening up too quickly here can be a dangerous combination. Instead, we need to broadly spend more money to buy more from several vaccine producers.
F2: First you were a hardliner, then you called for openings, now you’re cautious again. While the proposal is popular, voters notice you’ve corrected yourself once more. Others, especially from within FDP and AfD, gripe about ongoing lockdowns - I guess you can’t always make everyone happy. This should definitely keep Covid under control though.

F2: A bit unorthodox for the Union candidate to take such a regulatory approach - but the CSU is traditionally leftwards of the CDU on economics.

If anything, we need to come back to our roots and move this country to the right.
F3: Your biting ideological stance as well as your outright Merkel critiques leak out to the press and dominate the headlines for a few days - this isn’t just bad for party unity, it also directly contradicts your pledge to follow in Merkel’s footsteps!

Your stance is poison to most voters, SPD and Greens rule you out as chancellor in return, and even the FDP might be a hard sell now. The AfD is tempted by the prospect of power - but they’ll drive a hard bargain.

A1: Afghanistan is the biggest blowback for the West since Vietnam. The USA has the main responsibility here, that’s where the decision for this retreat was made. We need to reevaluate our relationship with NATO in its current form.
F1: The USA’s retreat was the deciding factor in this situation, but your repeated Anti-Nato rhetoric is concerning to almost anyone. You reiterate that it’s about reforming the alliance, not abolishing it - but those nuances fall under the rug in the incoming fire. Almost everyone else is attacking you over this.

F1: Isolationism is against almost everything the CDU stands for. The last time a major party has parroted neutrality was the SPD in the 50’s, while your party has traditionally championed European and Western integration. Safe to say, your eccentric stance falls under heavy criticism.

A2: Habeck is a strong candidate, and my main opponent for the chancellorship. But he isn’t invulnerable - and with the right tone, we could sweep some of his voters right from under his feet. Time to take the velvet gloves off - let’s focus on him.
F2: Four years ago, few would have expected a minor party like the Greens having a serious shot at the chancellorship. You have averted attacking Habeck so far - but maybe at the end of this campaign, casting doubt on his person can give you the final edge. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - Let’s hope you can make it count.

A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form this coalition after the election?
F1: This might be a weak point for Scholz - but when you publicly entertained a coalition with the AfD, you abandoned any moral high ground you’d have. He and Habeck vehemently criticize you on empowering fascists and win the debate by a landslide, in what proves to be a humiliating affair for you.

F3: You might have had an opening there, but not only is Scholz still Merkel’s Vice Chancellor, the moderators point out how your own policy ideas don’t differ that much from your opponents. While Habeck keeps mostly to himself, Scholz quips that you’ve either converted to Social Democracy or finally accepted the “economic realities of the 21st century”. Knock-Out.

Don’t get it wrong: you have to be affluent to vote Green. I am worried that Germany would lose jobs and fall behind under a chancellor Habeck - the CDU/CSU is the true party of the environment.
F2: You gamble that you can win this election on the Greens very own turf. However, your credibility on climate action has gone down since your nomination - Habeck hits on your shortsightedness concerning the Climate Protection Act and your record in Bavaria. He bests you in a decisive victory, for what seems to be a major setback for your image.

We need a new push in talking climate, moving away from coal and towards regenerative energy with a concrete plan of action - I have the economic competence to lead us through this crisis without tempo limits or flight bans.
F1: Habeck criticizes you sharply on the details of your policies, and while you do have more executive experience than him, your ambition on climate change seems to have faltered since the start of this campaign. He gets in some good attacks, Scholz doesn’t even register - the Greens end up on top in most polls.

F1: While the CDU/CSU as a whole is hurt by this scandal, you do try to mitigate its worst effects. It turns out the CSU is deeply involved, but your proactive steps reinforce your personal popularity.
A2: Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened. Luckily, it seems like the CDU is in more trouble than the CSU, so maybe I can use this to paint me as a more competent party leader.
F2: More and more corrupt dealings come to light, but it’s mostly Laschet who is crushed under their weight. The CSU seems to be deeply involved, and your numbers sag a bit - but by keeping yourself in the background, your CDU colleague falls faster, just as planned.
A4: We have to deflect from this as much as possible. I will make it clear that I have zero tolerance for corruption, but I will refrain from any incendiary statements. I don’t want to get associated with this personally.
F4: In time, the scandal becomes too big to downplay. The Union as a whole suffers a serious crisis in confidence. At least your personal popularity stays largely intact - but this is still your party we’re talking about, and people will only be able to vote for you through them.

A3: Why get head over heels with a statement? Let’s wait until Habeck says something, then respond to him in co-opting the more popular parts of his program, while criticizing bans and other incursions into people’s personal lives. We know what polls well and what doesn’t, let’s use that to our advantage!
F3: Not a bad plan. You and Habeck battle it out, and you get to ingratiate yourself to conservatives and centrists. But, <i>Obacht</i>, Markus! With the convenient timing of your statement, your cunning political tactics are noticed by a few journalists. They’re not always praising it…

F3: <i>Saxendi!</i> As Habeck stays uncontroversial and regal, many people question your silence on climate policies over the next few days, when you’ve been known to be pretty engaged with the topic normally. Are you trying to avoid giving the Greens a bump? Well, your strategy doesn’t pay off, as voters wanted something more proactive from you…

Q20A1 wenn opportunism <5
A1: I mean, in the end, the whole thing with the Maut just went horribly wrong, and was a real problem. That’s just a pity. It wasn’t a sole CSU or Scheuer-project though!
F1: <i>Tja, da fragt man sich, woran hat es jelegen.</i>. <br>Your apology seems evasive, but the topic disappears into the background, mostly. There are enough other things going on that giving a pat mention and moving on seems to be a prudent course of action.

F1: <i>Tja, da fragt man sich, woran hat es jelegen.</i>. <br>Your apology seems childish to almost everyone. In fact, when pressed further, you have nothing to give except platitudes - and your nonchalant attitude about a matter which cost the state millions of Euros sticks as a talking point, unfortunately.

Q22A2, nicht EQ1A3, opportunism <5
A2: It’s a disgrace how so many good people would now have to live under civil strife and a possible Taliban takeover. We at least have to take in those who cooperated with our troops - we owe it to them for their service. We should also further support the UN refugee agency financially.
F2: You’ve been critical of refugees in the past - this is a change in directions, similar to the one Merkel had in 2015. Nonetheless, people sympathize with the gruesome situation in Afghanistan, so no one blames you for changing your opinion. In fact, a few cultural progressives might have less resistance towards you now.

Q24A3 wenn Opportunism <5, nicht Q8A4
A3: Scholz likes to pretend he’s a moderate, but the program of his party is ideological and leftwing, with unrealistic promises regarding pensions and the minimum wage. It shows that the SPD as a whole is unfit to govern, and a symbol of past days.
F3: Not a bad idea. While Scholz is still Merkel’s Vice Chancellor, riffing on the usual Union talking points gets you far enough, as your natural charisma carries them to the centrists you want to win. Habeck doesn’t really latch onto the critique, seeing him as not much of a threat. You seem to narrowly win the debate ahead of him, with Scholz discredited for a final time.

F3: You might have had an opening there, but Scholz has a simple retort: <i>At least he has an ideology</i>. With your opportunism on display for everyone throughout this campaign, you’re shut down pretty quickly. Habeck senses a weakness, pledging a renewed political climate - and as much as you loathe it, the Red-Green flirting carries away a common victory against you.

Q24A4 wenn Opportunism >15
A4:  Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as a populist to rise above the pack.
F4: Confidence is everything. <i>Scheiß da nix, dann feid da nix!</i> You’ve perfected the charismatic populism, despite the critics - and even though you haven’t prepared any talking points, as you rattle away your best hits, regardless of any attacks against you or pivots you’re making, somehow… the German people are into it. Congratulations, Markus, you’ve strongmanned yourself to victory in the Triell, somehow. <i>Do legst die nieda.</i>

Q26A2 wenn Opportunism <5
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason. We’re not in an ideological bubble - politics need to take care of the political center. We need a strong state when talking about security, and a liberal and worldly state when talking about the people’s quality of life. This is the compass to the future.
F2: <i>Wea ko, dea ko.</i> You are the centrist in this debate - playing on this is a good strategy. You seem regal, stately, trustworthy, and provide for a good alternative in between two “change”-candidates. While you might not crack open voter bases to the left or right, swing voters are convinced that you had a decent night, although Habeck ain’t far behind.

F2: You are the centrist in this debate, after all. Their arguments about the CSU’s costly proposals of the past, like the Maut, are hard for you to refute, but overall, giving a generic, predictable policy outlook polls well with certain voters. Scholz tries a similar strategy - Habeck takes away a win by plurality, but both of you are not far behind.

F2: <i>Des wead nix gscheids ned.</i> Their arguments about the CSU’s costly proposals of the past, like the Maut, completely undermines your record. Not only that, with this generic pitch, your trustworthy is called into question: do you actually believe in anything? In any case, Scholz convinces most viewers at home, while you’re far off in Third place.
