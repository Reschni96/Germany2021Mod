Q1: Losing hurts. But as you know, every defeat is just one bump in the road, one opportunity to become stronger on your way to success. For now, Armin Laschet has prevailed in the contest for the chancellor candidacy - but the show must go on. As you have to play second fiddle to the CDU leader, what will be your strategy over the coming months?
A1: We’ll play nice. We would burn any of the bridges we have built if we are to undermine Laschet’s efforts to become chancellor. Maybe there’s a good spot in his cabinet for me in store? Anyways, I’ll be inviting him to Bavaria frequently, so that our party gets a good result in the fall.
F1: Laschet is happy about your grace, and extends his hand to bury the hatchet. While the campaign gets going as normal, you are considered the winner of the people’s hearts. If he wins, you have a good shot at an executive position on the Federal level - if he loses, you’re in a good spot for 2025. For now, Laschet will try his hand at “Making Germany Together”...
A2: <i>I’ll be back.</i>... get it? That was an Arnie-impression! Man Terminator 1 is great… Anyways, we need to build on the connections we’ve forged so far. Publicly, we’re gonna campaign alongside Laschet, but behind closed doors, I will waste no time to consolidate my forces. This man is weak, he’s gonna lose. And I will be vindicated, come 2025…
F2: “If it bleeds, we can kill it”… the same goes for Laschet’s campaign. Soon after the announcement, the Greens come out with Robert Habeck as their candidate, and he stands no chance. Your influence in the party grows - proportional to the size of Laschet’s polling deficit. Come 2025, you won’t be “Making Germany Together” anymore, it’ll just be you…
A3: He doesn’t have it in him to run a successful campaign, so we’ll be doing it for him. The CSU will disentangle our campaign infrastructure from the CDU, running on its own course - an ambitious line on climate, a conservative tone on social issues, and a hard line against woke culture. When our result will improve, in contrast to Laschet, they’ll see who was the better option.
F3: Who ever said anything about burying the hatchet? It seems the real power struggle has just begun. As you publicly threaten the cooperation of CDU and CSU, the poll numbers of the Union as a whole tank. The Greens and the SPD seem much more competent and united. As several allies abandon you in the wake of this catastrophe, it’s clear: you’ve overdone it. Your CSU party-chair gets shaky, as Laschet tries his hand at “Making Germany Together” regardless…
A4: I’m… I’m tired of it all. This was so embarrassing. I quit. I just want to watch movies… another Star Wars marathon, perhaps? Oh, I always wanted to go to FedCon!
F4: Markus, no, don’t give up! This was your dream, for all of your life! You know how many times Franz-Josef Strauss failed? Your CSU is -<br>... oh well. I mean, I get it. Politics sucks. There’s no friendship, no goodwill, no earnesty, no sense of aesthetics… just pure, hard, power games. Some might do it out of greed, others out of conviction. But at the end of the day, it can break people. At least Laschet seems to be serious about “Making Germany Together”. Maybe he can change things.
