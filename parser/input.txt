CDU-Merz

Q1: January 2021: The CDU is in a state of upheaval following Merkel's announcement of retirement. <br>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was her handpicked successor, but after she faltered, the party is looking for a new leader. After losing to her narrowly in 2018, you feel like the second time around is your time for a comeback - how do you want to convince the delegates to vote for you instead of Armin Laschet or Norbert Röttgen?
A1: Let’s be true to myself in a similar pitch to 2018. Maybe we can eschew policies for broader rhetoric and answer to some criticism about me: I do not have an old-fashioned view of women, or else my wife wouldn’t have married me, and I will not cooperate with the AfD. I demand a lot from myself and the party and will provide strong leadership.
F1: You have more appeal than in 2018, especially since Laschet isn’t as specifically Merkel-endorsed. Unfortunately, you’re still doubted to be the best man for the job and some cringe at your defensiveness. You lose to Laschet and have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor this fall.
A2: Perhaps I can appeal to third-wheeler Norbert Röttgen, maybe even strike a deal with a future cabinet post. To do that, I want to talk about climate change, how technology can solve these problems and how fear is not the answer, as well as the need to do better in appealing to women and young people.
F2: While Röttgen and you come from different wings of the party, he is tempted by a return to politics and does put in a good word for you in the second round, even though you’re obviously pandering. In an upset, you actually eke out Laschet very narrowly and win the leadership contest.
A3: I want to strike a stately tone in the wake of the pandemic, and present myself in a more moderate tone than before. I want to praise Germany's capabilities of innovation, focus on modernization, optimistically look towards the future and bring this country together, like the CDU always did over 52 combined years of government.
F3:  There is certainly a wind of change flowing through this country, and your attempt at threading the needle between praising the party and modernizing the country with a move towards the center goes over well. In somewhat of an upset, you are vindicated from 2018 and win out against the blander Laschet.
A4: This party, and more importantly this country, desperately needs a fresh face, not someone who stands for nothing more than a continuation. The failure of Kramp-Karrenbauer has shown we need new answers on many topics: what we’re doing right now is not enough. Even after Covid things will hardly return to normalcy.
F4: Considering you’ve been part of CDU leadership in the early 2000s, you’re hardly a fresh face, even though you’ve been out of politics for a while. Also, your negativity has soured some delegates. You decisively lose your second attempt to Laschet and have to watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor this fall.

Q2: Congratulations, you are now the 12th party leader of the Christian Democratic Union! You are not the official chancellor candidate of the Union of CDU and CSU yet, but hopefully, that will just be a formality. In your acceptance speech at the convention, what will be your emphasis?
A1: We have a lot to thank Angela Merkel for. She always thinks first before talking. She is leaving the country in an overall good state. She has set new standards, which her successor must fulfill - big shoes to step in. I will do my best to govern decisively and competently to continue her legacy.
F1: You and Merkel were never good friends, going back to your rivalry during the opposition years, when she finally won out over you. At least you’re trying - unfortunately, for many, this is you kissing too much arse. To some, your praises even awkwardly showcase certain contrasts to her.
A2: We need to fight for the political center of our country. Despite some of my personal beliefs, I will keep moving the party into the future, with a moderate course on the issues of the day and a commitment to our social market economy: The quality of a society shows itself beyond supply and demand.
F2: In a bid to unify the party, you’re reaching out to the moderate wing - but they are still quite suspicious of you, while your core supporters are deflated by your concessions. Stay true to yourself and be authentic, that’s your strength!
A3: The right wing of the party which has often been ignored by Merkel is still a significant force, my election has shown that. Under my leadership, we will define a better profile for our party. I want to appeal to those often forgotten: one vote for the AfD is half a vote for Red-Red-Green. We can not afford that.
F3: This is what the people who elected you wanted to hear. It’s time to reshape the Union in your image, to fight for what’s right - and snatch those protest votes away from the AfD, into your camp. Just don’t alienate the centrists, or your opponents will certainly try to capitalize.
A4: There will be no “rightwards shift” of the CDU under my leadership, I am a pragmatist and stand by most policies of the Merkel era. However, we need a clearer profile in contrast to the left, to stand by our values. I want to especially emphasize my neoliberal economic views.
F4: Good hedge. Ideological profile is one of the things on which you disagree most with Merkel - it’s said she sometimes almost governed like a Social Democrat, muddling the differences between CDU and SPD. Defining your party more economically rightward has supporters and detractors, but it will rekindle the political debate.

Q3: March 2021: COVID-19 has shaped the lives of people in Germany and across the world for the past years. Now that the winter is over, a lot of people are demanding an end to the harsh lockdowns. While you’re not currently a holder of an office, as CDU leader and potential chancellor candidate, you’re asked for your opinion.
A1: While the lockdowns were necessary in the past, now that we have started vaccinating people, it is time to return to normalcy. I am confident the government will see that the current measures just aren’t proportionate anymore. We don’t need any more fear mongering and alarmism.
F1: Your appeal is mostly ignored by states and federal government, and shortly after, cases start to surge again. Political opponents from your left mock you, and famous virologist Christian Drosten tweets about you critically.
A2: The situation is still very volatile and it is better to be cautious than reckless. We should keep the lockdowns for the foreseeable future, and only open up on strict criteria.
F2: You don’t stand out a lot with this minor pivot, but maybe that’s a good thing. When cases start to surge again in the spring, the view of your competency is strengthened. Not all are satisfied though - some view prolonged lockdowns as unconstitutional, especially in East Germany.
A3: Generally, I’m in favor of opening up - we need to be mindful of the constitutionality of some measures. However, we always have to closely look at the numbers, and let the states decide individually depending on the local situation. This pandemic isn’t over.
F3: You appeal a bit to those critical of the current policies, but you aren’t too far out of the mainstream. Either way, you stay out of the limelight, but with you away from the governmental apparatus, maybe that’s a good thing.
A4: This is a decision that the federal government and the states have to make together. I will wait and see what this process achieves, and not risk undermining it with brash rhetoric.
F4: People expect more leadership from a supposed future chancellor. While the measures are effective at keeping Covid at bay, you are criticized for your invisibility while other politicians get the credit, inside and outside your party.

Q4: You’ve been invited to a talk show to talk about your forté, tax policy. Another topic is the  “Black Zero”, which mandates a balanced budget. The left and left-of-centre seeks more investments, paid for by taxing the rich, while the FDP seeks widespread tax reductions. How do you want to frame your position?
A1: Under no circumstances will we raise taxes, but in the light of the crisis, we do need fiscal responsibility. We will phase out the extra tax of the Soli and try to reduce the burden on small and medium-income earners while always keeping the budget balanced, in keeping with the “Black Zero” - we can’t have unnecessary debts.
F1: This is a mainstream position in your party, but not what people elected you for. Some worry that your policies won’t be too different from Merkel after all - although former Minister of Finance and current President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Black Zero”, thanks you in private.
A2: The Covid crisis has left a massive hole in our budget that we have to plug somehow. We have to be measured, but a tax increase will likely be unavoidable to avoid harsh debts that can hurt our economy even further.
F2: This goes against everything you’ve been saying in the past, and pundits are confused about what made you change your mind this radically. Disappointed voters are in danger of turning towards the FDP and other political opponents, the AfD capitalizes by criticizing the “uniparty”.
A3: Taxes for private households should stay where they are or even be lowered by phasing out the Soli. More importantly, we need to deregulate to further our economic potential and help corporations that have proven to have successful business models. As little State as necessary, as much market as possible.
F3: While this is a bit less radical than you are known for, it’s still in line with your “trickle-down”-philosophy.  It’s a departure from what Merkel did, but that could be a good thing - by and large, your proposals are popular in your party.
A4: To stimulate the economy after the Covid crisis and reduce the burden on the public, taxes have to be lowered across the board for both private households and corporations. We also have to streamline tax bureaucracy, and simplify structures - every citizen should be able to calculate his income tax on his beer coaster.
F4: For more than 20 years, you have championed something like this. Although you were criticized for your “beer coaster”-quip in the past, it remains a symbol of hope for those seeking to simplify tax structures. Some are uneasy about fiscal stability or fear more state debt, but you know your path is the right one.

Q5: Shook to your core, you read the headline of the 11/2021 issue of<i> Der Spiegel</i>: <br>” <i>‘Schwarzer Filz’ - Mask deals, venality, failure in crisis: the deep fall of the Union. </i> “<br>They reveal how several CDU/CSU MPs are implicated as part of a corrupt scheme to sell overpriced medical masks to government organizations, in order to profit from the crisis. Journalists run in your door, asking for a comment on the first crisis of your party leadership.
A1: I was as shocked as everyone else when I found out about this! The parliamentary immunity of these MPs should promptly be removed so they can be properly investigated.  Let’s however not judge the whole party for the actions of some black sheep.
F1: Some wonder if the party structures really aren’t to blame, seeing how deep the connections lay, but you provide a strong and honest answer. Some in your party are nervous about how fast you were to drop your colleagues just like that - others believe you’re downplaying the issue.
A2: Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened.
F2: Journalists keep heckling you for more of a comment - this comes off as very suspicious, especially as more and more of these corrupt dealings come to light. You are eventually forced to give a stronger statement, but your leadership is rocked by discord early with this development.
A3: This is nothing but a political hit job by a left-wing magazine in an election year. I’m sure further investigations will prove the innocence of these MPs.
F3: Look, <i>Der Spiegel </i>isn’t The Jacobin. Nobody is buying this, as the report is well sourced and new details come out almost every day. This makes you seem very out of touch with the public mood; some right-wingers on social media praise you, but the AfD seeks to profit from government corruption.
A4: These deals are another sad example of how the intertwining of politics and business leads to corrupt dealings. Under my leadership, we will root out this corruption - it has no place inside the CDU/CSU! Our politics have to show more integrity.
F4: You, the man who switched from politics to consulting firm Blackrock and back, are absolutely the wrong man to strike this kind of populist tone. Other parties immediately jump on this, and you are mocked in satire TV like the <i>Heute Show</i>. <br>
By the way, did you know the 2021 youth word of the year is “cringe”?

Q6: April 2021: Minister of Finance and current Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been declared chancellor candidate by the SPD last year already and there are rumors the Green party is about to nominate either Annalena Baerbock or Robert Habeck next. Do you want to formally declare your candidacy before they do?
A1: This seems like a good time to declare my candidacy, yes. Though before I declare, I will make a courtesy call to Markus Söder, the party leader of our sister party, the CSU, to make sure he won’t oppose me.
F1: To your surprise, man of power Markus Söder tells you he wants to become the candidate of the Union as well. You both make your intentions public on the same day - and his favorability seems much better than yours. Immediately, things get ugly…
A2: Yes, I will inform the upper party echelons and formally announce this during a press conference in the party headquarters. There is no time to lose! It’s time for the campaign to get going.
F2: Journalists are surprised by what seems like a hasty announcement, but this move was expected at some point. Awkwardly, Markus Söder, leader of the CSU, declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union as well, some days later. At least it looks like you have a small headstart in this cockfight.
A3: You know, it might be better to wait this out a bit longer - just biding our time and consolidating our party influence. I can declare after whatever announcement the Green party makes to get them out of the limelight.
F3: This backfires when the leader of your sister party and enjoyer of the spotlight Markus Söder declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union the next day after. You’re taken by surprise and quickly follow suit, but this strikes an ugly confrontation between you two.

Q7: Söders ambitions were always clear, but this is shaping out to be a blatant (and ugly) confrontation. <br>You and him both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU. You have some bully pulpit at your side - although polling shows Söder to be much more popular than you. How do you want to decide this contest?
A1: Let’s call every big name in the party, curry every favor, maybe we can even get Merkel herself to weigh in. I can’t have this decided by vote and risk being humiliated, I want this decided by the party elites now.
F1: There’s one small problem with this plan - Merkel has a small vendetta with you, from before she became chancellor. Now she controls the apparatus - and doesn’t lift much of a finger to help you. After tense days, it’s clear Söder is the preferred candidate of most involved. You step aside for his campaign; “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: It’s no secret that Söder doesn’t like me. This is a personal vendetta and drags down both parties in an election year. I am the rightfully elected leader of the Union and will fight tooth and nail for a unified Union, not one born from divisive attacks like from the Minister-President.
F2: He tries to fight back, saying he only does what he believes is right, but his counterattacks seem to just strengthen your point. The whole ordeal paints the Union in a bad light - but more and more insiders take your side, as Söder eventually yields. Time to prove all doubters wrong. “New Times - New Responsibilities”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F3: While this is true, a lot of people in the CDU also preferred Söder, taken by his moderation and apparent electability. Some expected this, but you narrowly lose the vote and have to support Söder from the sidelines. Let’s hope you’re still taken seriously enough, “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F4: While the vote is closer than you’d like, you come out victorious and vindicated. Söder accepts the outcome, but seems to have given up on the Union's chances this election. The whole ordeal rankled the party and your polling is lower than Söders hypotheticals: time to prove them wrong. “New Times - New Responsibilities”.

Q8: Wow, that was a close one! First, let’s take a breath. <br>Now, you have finally jumped the last hurdle and formally became the chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. Congratulations! What talking point do you want to hit on at the press conference?
A1: First and foremost, I want to thank Markus Söder for accepting this outcome. We have to be united as a party to win this fall. Apart from that, I will hit my usual talking points, about stability, conservatism, praising the Union and acting on our values.
F1: Söder can’t even bring himself to smile as you say this. Even though he endorses you as expected, with how much he dislikes you, it’s unlikely he will be a big help during the election campaign. Clearly, he’s just a <i>Beleidigte Leberwurst</i>. Other than that, the speech is unsurprising.
A2: This closer-than-expected contest has convinced me that I need to further moderate my attitude and rhetoric on some topics. I’ll focus on a competent response to the pandemic and the climate crisis, how we need strong and stable leadership in these trying times and new ideas to move all of Germany forward, to build on Angela Merkel's successes.
F2: Now that you’re officially the chancellor candidate, moving to the center is not the worst call. Some critics sense your pivot, but the party and most voters are happy that you’re embracing moderation and reconciliation with Merkel. Even Söder endorses you with an invitation to Bavaria.
A3: I will give a largely non-political speech. We need to focus on the importance of cohesion and trust in our society, the values of hard work, to come together as one in the wake of this crisis, not letting our different views divide us. If the biggest common denominator in a society shrinks, it will be harder to find consensus and compromise.
F3:  Admirable sentiments, though kind of awkward for a man with a private plane to talk about this stuff. That said, rallying the party base and casting a broad net beyond them is what the Union wants. Don’t stretch it too thin though - pundits keep debating on what your actual government would look like.
A4: The success of the AfD showed us that some people don’t feel taken seriously. Our country is in dire need of change and a new direction. I will promise to modernize Germany while letting our conservative values guide us in this progress. A new Germany, responsible and sensible.
F4: While your party has been in government for almost 16 years, you stand for something different than the current administration, and could give a certain new spark to the party and the country. There are still many people who were happy with the more centrist CDU though - don’t alienate the Merkel fans.

Q9: The Green party has, for the first time in its history, nominated a chancellor candidate, Annalena Baerbock. In a development few would have expected four years ago, she appears to be your main contender, even polling ahead of you sometimes, while Olaf Scholz of the SPD is far behind in third place. What’s your strategy regarding your two opponents?
A1: The Green party is always surging a few months before elections and comes crashing down in time, just like in 2011 after Fukushima. I’m not too worried - we should still focus more on competing with the SPD, our traditional opponent.
F1: Maybe you’re onto something, after all, the duopoly of CDU and SPD has held for over 70 years - but dismissing Baerbock seems foolish right now, considering the Greens currently poll much higher than at any point in their history. Perhaps you know something the media does not?
A2: I will take this development very seriously. Let’s attack them as a party that prefers heavy-handed government intervention over pragmatic market solutions - they run the risk of splitting our society apart even further and hurting our economy.
F2: This helps win back some swing voters who are concerned about some of the Greens specific policies, and riles up your base.
A3: Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for center-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and attack them moderately where we can.
F3: You’re probably right, but don’t get complacent: you are vying for swing voters with both parties and have lost ground recently. By keeping your conservatives and Merkel-approvers together, you could come up on top by default - you might need one of them in your coalition though, and they seem quite skeptical of that for now.
A4: Actually, this is a bit ridiculous and reminds me of the publicity stunt the FDP pulled in 2002 when they nominated Guido Westerwelle as chancellor candidate. Let’s mock them for their hubris and don’t refer to Baerbock as a legitimate chancellor candidate.
F4: “Petty, disparaging and rudely chauvinistic” op-eds say. Seeing how Baerbock is the only female chancellor candidate, you’re called out on what is perceived to be a sexist dog whistle. Getting the Greens to support you in a coalition agreement now will probably be quite the ordeal - hopefully, you won’t need them.

Q10: Michael Kretschmer, your party colleague and Minister-President of Saxony, has recently traveled to Moscow and has been criticized for that visit. What’s your stance on current policies regarding Germany’s relationship with Russia and Putin?
A1: Russia is not our enemy, though I’m very critical of some things Putin has done. The opening of the Nord-Stream 2 Pipeline should be contingent on some conditions, like freeing Alexei Navalny.
F1: A nuanced take that comes off as measured, responsible and is appreciated by many voters - though in East Germany, people tend to be Russia-friendlier. You dodge any direct criticism of Merkel's and Kretschmer's diplomatic approaches, but you’re free to toughen up Germany’s stance once you’re in charge anyhow.
A2: Kretschmer was clearly in the wrong here. It’s unclear how much negotiations with the current Russian regime can even achieve. We should also immediately stop building the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F2: You seem to consistently attack Merkels’ Russia policies. Polish politicians praise you on social media, and it’s an agreeable take for your party - but tougher on Russia than the median opinion. Germany has a deep-lying trauma towards warmongering. Maybe you’ll be vindicated later on…
A3: Kretschmer is completely right, we have to talk more with Russia, not less. I’m all in favor of more dialogue and stronger economic ties with Russia. Besides, it’s not like the USA has always been reliable, we should look to new partnerships.
F3: This is a massive and somewhat embarrassing flip-flop, considering past statements of yours. Furthermore, your statement draws more ire from longtime americanophile Angela Merkel. Maybe Gerhard Schröder agrees with you on principle, but don’t expect any SPD voters to cross over because of this.
A4: This whole thing is overblown, the trip was mostly for cultural exchange. I don’t have much to say about this. We stand on our commitment to Nato.
F4: You were much more outspoken about this issue in the past - have you changed your mind? Anyhow, this issue isn’t going away, and you haven’t really pleased anyone with this statement. Your commitment to Nato comes to no surprise and doesn’t register.

EQ1: You’re invited to a talk show about immigration and refugees. Although tempers have cooled a bit since 2015, the discussion around Merkel's decision to welcome the refugees 6 years ago is still relevant - particularly for the AfD, who got driven into parliament on this issue in 2017. Germany is still a popular destination for many foreigners seeking a better life, yet the nation does not seem prepared for this. What stance do you take in this debate?
A1: I think Merkel did what she could, we needed to take those people in to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Today though, we need to be more mindful of European border security. To that end, we want to strengthen the EU border enforcement agency Frontex.
F1: While you’re trying to dodge the topic of your past criticisms of Merkel, you’re straddling a tight line with your promises of a stricter policy in the future. It works for some. Of course, the left and right are equally pearl clutching at your comments.
A2: There’s no way around it - Germany is an immigration country. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration laws - we don’t have a good system in place to attract qualified immigrants, who could be advantageous to our economy and demographic situation.
F2: A surprising answer, coming from you - immigration is an often suggested solution to numerous problems, but nothing you’re known for. Your original supporters and some CSU colleagues are wary of unintegrated people straining the social safety net, and not everyone thinks you’re genuine, but if you want to move to the center, this is a reasonable way to do it.
A3: Merkel was absolutely right to take in these people. We’re saying: Refugees Welcome! As a western country partially responsible for colonialism, we have a responsibility for humanitarian aid, including initiatives to rescue capsized refugee boats in the mediterranean.
F3: While a small subset of <i>Gutmenschen</i> are happy about your pivot, no one buys this. Your strange pivot has irritated the whole political sphere, and your base feels betrayed. Your office is swamped by angry calls warning you about another 2015 - and the AfD seems quite welcoming for some of these critics.
A4: On this issue, Merkel has erred - her rhetoric was dangerous in provoking even more refugees and immigrants to come here. We simply can’t take everyone. We need more border security in the EU and faster deportation processes to avoid another disaster - 2015 can’t repeat itself.
F4: You reiterate earlier stances you’ve taken - there does seem to be a right-wing-pivot in the CDU, at least on this issue. You do get the attention of a good lot of former conservatives that are now in the AfD’s camp: if you stay consistent, they might come back home. AfD party chief Meuthen tentatively praises you at a press conference.

Q11: May 2021: A bombshell has rocked the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin has already gone to work on making the law stricter. What is your opinion on this issue?
A1: This was a bad decision by the court. The Climate Protection Act already went far enough and I’m not in favor of hurting the economy with a stricter climate policy. We need to look out for our workers and businesses, regulation is not the answer.
F1: Not unusual for you to say something like this, but it’s still out of touch. You give credence to Green criticism of you and make waves in the media. Even your party can read the room, and the new law must comply with the decision either way. Maybe your maverick ways can appeal to a more silent majority?
A2: We should not move too quickly here  - hasty legislative developments forbid themselves. While the court order has to be respected, we have to analyze the situation in detail before we change any laws.
F2: Indirectly, you criticize the government’s more proactive response to the ruling. You make some good points, but also drive a wedge between CDU leadership and Merkel's administration -  that might not prove useful for party unity. Voters might be more likely to side with the chancellor.
A3: As I’m not a member of the government, I don’t have much to say here. I trust them to find a sensible solution - climate change is an important issue, but we need to be measurable.
F3: Good hedge: you avoided contradicting yourself or the government's response, although deferring to Merkel is quite unlike you. A new law is drafted and passed - and the SPD tries to take credit, as they feel vindicated for their lobbying for stronger climate protections within the coalition.
A4: Economy and ecology now require better coordination with each other. This is an opportunity to work out a truly sustainable climate policy for our country - we must do more than we are doing now.
F4: Environment-conscious voters and the moderate wing of your party are happy about this timid pivot, though some accuse you of being opportunistic. You choose to go with the times and hope that your base will follow you. You also have something to show to the Greens in hypothetical coalition talks now.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Links
EQ2: Up until now, your campaign has been dominated by a surprisingly centrist attitude, tilting center-left even. To many, this seems strangely evocative of Angela Merkel, but your original supporters are alarmed. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: Yes, I do. Angela Merkel is a highly esteemed stateswoman and one of the best chancellors this country ever had - although to modernize our party, we have to recalibrate our course on climate change and protecting our social safety net. The CDU is an innovative party of the 21st century, and I will not let myself get intimidated by right-wing demagogues.
F1: Way to kiss ass. Few believe you’re genuine. But among average voters, the new CDU does get some looks from potential SPD voters and even rural Greens - Your supporters though are disappointed. This slight makes many of them regret voting for you - they might even consider more radical options on their ballot.
A2: I do not think in ideological categories, I’m simply standing for what I think is good for Germany. The CDU is the party of good governance - not radicalism, both leftist or rightist.
F2: The German people like pragmatism. Eschewing Merkel is a good move, and your authentic attempts to show off a modern Christian Democracy raise your personal favorability. Just keep your base in mind - they are wildly hungry for some red meat, and might become hostile if they aren’t fed soon.
A3: I needed to unite the party around me at the start of the campaign - now we can try to tilt the discourse rightwards, taking Merkel’s supporters with us while framing my conservative positions as more reasonable.
F3: The party has seemingly united around you, so now this tactic might be a good way to proceed. Your pivot back rightwards is noted by pundits and opponents alike, and was almost expected. It rekindles attacks against you, but more importantly, the enthusiasm of your base - getting out the activists out there can lead this campaign to victory!


Q12: A controversy from 2018 has resurfaced when you claimed that you were part of the middle class despite owning two private jets and earning around 1.000.000€ per year. Again and again, you’re asked to clarify - what’s your response?
A1: What else do people want me to say? I still stand by my statements, I’m a down-to-earth person, not part of some out-of-touch, super-rich elite. I own a respectable fortune, as many businessmen do.
F1: Doubling down might not be the wisest action here. You have more money than 99% of Germans - even sympathizers disagree with your wording. Satire shows are having a field day with this, and many less affluent voters are disgusted by the entitlement. Remember, the 2021 youth word of the year is “cringe”.
A2: Politicizing my private life like this is nothing more than a smear campaign. I vehemently reject the notion that my personal wealth has anything to do with how well I will lead this country.
F2: Your rebuttal has drawn the attention of the media. Voters liked Merkel's integrity and down-to-earth-edness - and you’re drawing an uncomfortable contrast here, politicization or not. This is unfortunately reinforcing a narrative about you being elitist.
A3: I would like to apologize. My words here were insensitive - I am of course much more well-off than the ordinary worker in this country. What I meant to say is that the middle class isn’t just a material category for me. Even as a politician, I’m just a regular guy.
F3: It helps to admit you were wrong, though as much as you might want it, you just aren’t seen as a regular guy with that much money. Journalists appreciate your candor, but the damage to your image might already be done. Let’s hope that’s not what people vote on this year.
A4: Who even dug up these two-year-old statements? I’ll give a brief comment that this has no relevance and hope that people focus on more important topics.
F4: After a few days of media coverage, all but the most left-wing publications move on from this. Your perceived elitism is still an issue that your opponents could use against you, however - better use the situation to change the topic to something more substantial.

Q13: You have been invited to give a speech about German foreign and defense policy. Members of the Bundeswehr stand in the crowd: they eagerly listen to what direction you want Germany to take on the world stage. Which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: For years and years, we have consistently missed the NATO aim to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defense. I strongly reaffirm our commitment to NATO and this goal! The West has to be united against potential threats.
F1: The audience cheers you on, as spending more on defense is always popular in more conservative circles, as is a commitment to the alliance. Not every potential voter is convinced of this, though - the anxiety about war runs deep in Germany’s collective memory.
A2: While I strongly reaffirm our support of a united Alliance and strong defense, I specifically want to call out Annalena Baerbock. She lacks a clear commitment to NATO, which is not appropriate for a chancellor.
F2: With how strong the Green Party has been in the polls lately, hitting on them seems like a good strategy. This is a usual attack against them, but even though they seem to move right on defense, it still seems to hit the spot after some of Baerbocks statements on the 2%-goal.
A3: I want to praise the work we’ve done so far and believe we are in a good spot. While I strongly reaffirm my commitment to NATO, we don’t need to spend more on defense than we do right now; we need to combat waste first and foremost.
F3: This does little to differentiate you from other parties and is softer on defense than the usual position of your party. A bit out of character, but it does give you some minor wiggle room on fiscal and foreign policy - be sure to make use of it after the election.
A4: No government budget is growing as quickly as our defense budget. I reject the notion we are not doing enough - furthermore, the presidency of Donald Trump has shown that the USA is not always a reliable ally. We should open up new dialogues with other nations such as China.
F4: Donald Trump is indeed very unpopular - but your statement comes off as oddly pacifistic to most of your supporters, and criticizing transatlanticism isn’t that popular in your party. Your past opponent Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, now Minister of Defence, seems very cold when asked about your stance.

EQ3: One salient issue is the topic of pensions, particularly in light of Germany's changing demographics. Currently, pensions are distributed from a fund financed by the current working populace. However, because the number of retirees seems to grow faster than the workforce, the system is thought to be unsustainable. How do you want to address this problem?
A1: The heart of this problem lies in Germany's low birth rates. We need to further encourage the founding of families, with benefits for married and childbearing couples. Family-friendly policies will strengthen our social cohesion and collective values and invest in our future.
F1: This is a good conservative answer that will motivate your base. <b>This has been the Union's line since its founding, and it does appeal to your older base as well as to young families. That said, this still seems naively passive to some. People also notice how this old-school approach is shared with the AfD.
A2: A sustainable answer to keep our social support net afloat lies in immigration. We are an attractive place in Europe for many seeking a safe and economically secure future, and we should finally implement a real immigration law, for example with a Canada-style point-system.
F2: An interesting twist that could modernize your image – but keep in mind, your base is worried about economic refugees and integration policies straining the social and fiscal health of the nation, and aren’t stoked about your pivot. Safe to say, the AfD immediately starts churning its fear mongering social media machine.
A3: It's clear that the current system is unsafe. We should build on our public pension system, reform the Riester-system, and refrain from raising the pension age any further than 67! We also need to introduce a higher state-provided minimum pension to fight old-age poverty.
F3: Opportunism or genuine concern? With you, no one seems to know. Your answer is taken as a rare critique of Merkel from her left. Many of your colleagues take you aside in concern, particularly on your plans to finance this, and experts actually recommend raising the retirement age. Hopefully this can fortify your older base and make unexpected inroads.
A4: We need to overhaul the bureaucratic costs of the system and listen to the decisions of the advisory councils. The mix of public, occupational and private pension systems contributes to safe pension levels, particularly occupational and private provisions should be strengthened. We can also look at Swedish-style stock-based pension funds.
F4: This is a broad attractive mix of moderate policies that show your engagement with the topic and unites your base. You avoid criticizing Merkel and offer some innovative solutions – though many fear another raise of the retirement age. To your opponents, this doesn't go far enough, of course.

Q14: June 2021: Things look to be on somewhat of an upswing. Baerbock is working herself through some scandals with allegations of plagiarism and an inconsistent CV, and on top, the CDU was the big winner at the provincial elections in Saxony-Anhalt, with Minister-President Reiner Haselhoff’s popularity being credited. What’s your reaction to this information?
A1:  I want to congratulate Haseloff for his strong performance. It shows that the citizens still trust the CDU to be the best governing party, and we want to emulate his strategy on a national scale.
F1: While his performance was impressive, his strategy was partially built on his incumbency as a “Landesvater”, something you can’t emulate. Still, it might not be a bad message to campaign on the good governance of your party. “For a Germany, in which we live well and gladly”, as Merkel advertised 4 years ago.
A2: Haseloff performed very well, but I want to emphasize that the AfD lost votes. When we keep appealing and listening to all people, without prejudice, we can win them back for the democratic parties.
F2: The need to win back AfD voters is definitely something that most parties can agree on - hopefully, your focus on this front can actually yield electoral success. It’s unlikely they’ll exit the parliament, but maybe Haseloff has some good advice - your brash persona might be uniquely fitting for this endeavor.
A3: This was a very strong performance. To show my gratitude, I will make an extra trip to Saxony-Anhalt and campaign with him for some nice pictures.
F3: Haseloff is glad to campaign with you. You definitely show your appreciation of Saxony-Anhalt, and East Germany notices. On your end, you enjoy some local <i> Rotkäppchen</i>-wine and <i>Baumkuchen</i> as well as an inter-denominational visit to Martin Luther's hometown, the Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

EQ4: With the campaign developing, Annalena Baerbock has caught criticism from the media. She’s dealing with numerous scandals: allegations of plagiarism in her book, an inconsistent CV, as well as failing to report extraparliamentary earnings on time. With her seemingly being your main opponent, how do you want to capitalize on this?
A1: We should definitely hit her on these topics. This is unprofessional behavior that should not happen in the chancellery. These concerns about her integrity have to be addressed.
F1: The plethora of scandals she encounters certainly works to her disadvantage - you keep her misgivings in the headlines, but to some keyboard warriors, you keep coming off as sexist. During all the sniping and back-and-forths, Olaf Scholz is recently seen more often with his signature “smurfy grin”.
A2: Not only that - did you notice how she used the N-Word in that interview, and had to be censored out? Such mistakes of communication are unacceptable for a chancellor, and the problematic nature of this faux pas should shed doubt on her character.
F2: You’re overreaching here. She was criticized for this, but not only did she apologize before the interview came out, it’s clear she said it in an antiracist context. To most people in Germany, this isn’t a big deal, and your attacks seem unnecessarily desperate.
A3: People can make their own decisions about this, what I want to talk about is substance. Her policies are expensive for the middle class and ineffective, and she knows it. She talks - I act.
F3: This works to rally up the base and makes a good pitch for your party - if this can really pierce through to the voter is unclear. Either way, people still notice Baerbocks misgivings, and they indeed don’t shed a good light on her.
A4: People aren’t clamoring for my comments here, they will be judged on their own. I want to stay positive and talk about the successes I will bring to Germany.
F4: You shed any danger of being accused of sexism while Baerbocks favorability slips on its own. However, the scandals don’t stay in the headlines for much longer, and the campaign keeps going as normal.


Q15: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbors, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. With all parties unveiling plans to rectify this, what focus do you want to lay?
A1: The pandemic has shown how ill-prepared our schools are. We need to continue improving digital infrastructure in education, through more training, technical assets and a national educational platform. That is what the CDU/CSU has worked on, and will continue doing.
F1: You’re right that this is important, and it’s in line with the current government's strategy - but many blame your party for the current misery. Quite a strange pivot for you to defend the current administration on this hill. The FDP especially needles you here, they have staked out digitalization as their favorite topic.
A2: Actually, we don’t have much to gain by talking about this topic - many voters see us as responsible for the current situation. Let’s downplay it as much as we can and focus on issues where we are seen as more competent, like matters of security or the economy.
F2: A fatalistic approach, but a reasonable one. Young voters are disappointed by your lack of a proper position, but they most likely aren’t in your reach anyhow. Some Union officials are a bit peeved that you aren’t talking about their purported successes, but even they can read the numbers.
A3: We need more efforts to further digitize Germany, the conditions for retaining our prosperity in the 21st century aren’t a given. We need to use the chances given by digitalization to come out stronger from this pandemic. We need to focus on improving our economic competitiveness.
F3: An expected answer, modernization is one of your favorite words after all. Improving the accessibility of Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is popular: most parties call for some action on this issue, but you’re a good salesman. Just keep the agenda on the economics, this is where you feel comfortable!
A4: Digitalization is a key issue - we need a digital transformation offensive. I want to especially emphasize that we will accomplish a nationwide 5G mobile network by 2025 and provide 15 billion Euro for Gigabit-networks. To that end, we will also establish a Ministry of Digital Innovation and Transformation.
F4: You’ve been outspoken on this issue before, so this goes over quite well. The 5G network is a strong promise that will especially help you in less urban areas, where even 4G coverage can be seen as luxurious in some corners. Your idea of a new Ministry for this topic shows your dedication, but some criticize that digitalization is a cross-sectional task that shouldn't be centralized.

EQ5: One of the more salient issues in the current political landscape across the western world is the question of rents, particularly for younger voters. Most economic and educational opportunities increasingly lie in the big cities of the country - where rent is constantly increasing, to the point where it becomes a serious political question. What is your answer to the housing question?
A1: We need to alleviate the housing market by building more. We need to build more than 100.000 housing units, using tax benefits. We should also provide funding to revitalize our cities and villages, advertise rural spaces and reduce the real estate transfer tax - every family should be able to own a home.
F1: A mainstream market-focused answer that will resonate with dozens of families dreaming of an ‘Eigenheim’, particularly in rural regions - the land for new buildings can get quite sparse in the cities. Critics note how your party hasn’t fulfilled its housing goals during the last 4 years, but you can surely do better than Merkel once you’re chancellor.
A2: We need to emphasize the creation of more social housing, built by modern standards available for those who need it most. For families, we can make buying empty buildings in the countryside easier for young people, as we do in NRW. Furthermore, we need to fight land speculation and close tax loopholes.
F1: A bit unorthodox for a Christian-Democrat to take such a regulatory approach - you break with current doctrines, but in a way that could be advantageous to you. Many agree something has to be done, urban and suburban voters might like this pivot. It should be noted the NRW program was introduced by the SPD though.
A3: The situation is tense. It’s clear that action is needed in the form of rent controls. A sharper, unlimited federal rent control program should be introduced. In places where the situation is very problematic, we stand for a so-called ‘rent moratorium’, where rent would only be able to increase with the inflation rate.
F3: Might I offer you a constitutional law lesson in these trying times? Similar plans in Berlin have been scrapped by the courts recently, to the applause of <i>your</i> colleagues! Your sudden leftist sympathies confuse everyone. You try to clarify you’re only talking about very temporary and selectively used measures, but this seems to be a flip-flop people will talk about for decades.
A4: We are vehemently against programs like rent controls. Social housing projects have failed to improve the situation - instead we need to support low income renters through housing subsidies. Regulations have to be cut back, we need slimmer bureaucracies and faster approval processes so that the market can sort itself out.
F4: You remain true to your supply-side loyalties - and draw comparisons to American conservatives. While you’ve riled up your base as always, you’re again contrasting Merkel, which might not be appreciated by her fans: especially those living in Germany’s cities. Scholz seems like a sensible alternative to them.



Q16: July 2021: Catastrophe hits. The meteorological low-pressure area <i>Bernd</i> has hit Central Europe and made several rivers burst over their banks. Disastrous rain and floods are affecting large areas of Germany. Your home state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is among the most affected - you are asked to comment.
A1: The most important thing we can do right now is support the affected regions. They need help now, quickly and unbureaucratically. We all need to come together to help the victims through this.
F1: A succinct response that is appreciated in the area. Without any government post, there’s not much you can do except give lip service - hopefully, your former opponent Armin Laschet is able to handle the situation in NRW well.
A2: I first want to state that my empathy goes to all affected by this flooding. However, we have to learn lessons from this - the destroyed buildings shouldn’t be rebuilt where they stood before, as zones in danger of flooding should be left empty. We need more measures to protect our community from floods.
F2: Some experts agree with you, and you show engagement with the topic without pivoting to the environment, as your opponents do. You do come across as a bit cold and heartless though, as many people want to rebuild their homes.
A3: First, we need to quickly and diligently help the affected regions with the cleanup operations. After that, we have to guarantee financial emergency aid for affected people, unequivocally. They need direct government assistance.
F3: Friedrich Merz advocating for government handouts? This response is seen as opportunistic by many. The affected won’t complain about the money, but you are confronted with certain contradictions in your philosophy and rhetoric.
A4: The floodings were a tragedy, yes, but I firmly reject the notion to politicize this. We need to come together and help people, that’s more important than speculating if this was caused by climate change or not.
F4: Those who tilt right applaud your pointed statement, but there’s a case to be made that this is a political statement as well. Either way, most scientists agree this is indeed caused by climate change - let’s hope you have some answers once the narrative develops.

Q17: Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear: 220 fatalities, 186 of those in Germany, the deadliest flood since 1962.<br> Your home, North Rhine Westphalia, is affected most directly. Among the mourning, your advisors somehow want you to stay in the headlines as someone without an active office.
A1: Actually, I don’t want to be seen as performative; there’s just not a lot I can do here. I won’t change my schedule on The Campaign Trail, though I will mention the event in my speeches, of course.
F1: Look, I know you love this game, but you could’ve at least traveled there, it’s your home! Though you keep yourself out of major headlines, your absence is still noted, and you’ve squandered an opportunity to show leadership. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.
A2: Okay, the media has their answer, now I have to get home quickly! The constituents of my district, the Hochsauerlandkreis in NRW, are directly affected. They aren’t the worst off, but if I want them to vote for me, I have to be there in these trying times.
F2: Your constituency, especially the cities of Sundern and your home Arnsberg, has indeed incurred heavy damages. Your neighbors appreciate your authentic worries, and the visits are quite appropriate. They aren’t very politicized and run under the radar of most media outlets though. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.
A3: Just visiting these areas is not enough! I have to get in there with the rescue teams. I want to be seen as a man of action, with rubber boots, and shovels and all. Get me some cameras, and some impactful photos with the local fire departments.
F3: This might have worked for former chancellor Schröder in 2002, but you look awkward and stilted, like you are just posing for the pictures. If you were trying to humble your image, you have achieved the opposite - the pictures are widely mocked and criticized by your opponents, and even by Schröder himself. Oops.
A4: Good point. We should also get out there and visit some affected towns - our President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in NRW in a few days, so let’s try to get some shared pictures with our head of state. To show that we are all united, stuff like that.
F4: In the midst of the President's speech, Minister-President Armin Laschet is caught on camera boyishly laughing at some unheard joke. <i>Laschet's Lacher</i> hits the media, and although you’re not affected, your advisors sideline your former opponent so things stay that way. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz experiences a surprising surge.

Q18: Climate change is a much-discussed topic again after the floods - it seems dire warnings of extreme weather events are starting to come true. In the wake of this, you have been asked if this had an impact on your stance on how to best combat climate change.
A1: I haven’t been the strongest advocate for climate action, but I want to reiterate my criticism of Merkel's handling. She said politics is made of what’s possible, but I disagree: you have to make certain things possible in politics. We should have the courage for a higher price for CO² certificates, and we can think about an earlier exit from coal than 2038.
F1: Your statement, while indeed reiterating earlier wordings of yours, comes off as a bombshell - you are pivoting leftwards of the Grand Coalition on this issue! Your home of NRW, a big coal producer is unhappy, your base feels betrayed - but your overtures to the Greens do not remain unnoticed.
A2: Climate change remains one of the, if not the most central political issue of our time. We need to noticeably strengthen our efforts now. These challenges can only be met with the most modern and newest technologies.
F2: Your statement keeps it light on the details and seems a bit stilted, but it is uncontroversial and agreeable with the public, while providing enough room for nuance. After all, your voters are mostly concerned with economic impacts on their own lifes, not ecological matters.
A3: Germany has already done a lot. We can't pretend like more climate action would prevent these things from happening. There will always be floods, even if you were to immediately enact every proposal by Fridays-For-Future. Climate change alone did not cause this catastrophe.
F3: Your stance is widely publicized, and even though your party is at your side, you come off as somewhat of a climate-sceptic. This places you outside the mainstream, especially as more and more scientists conclude that climate change does indeed have an effect on this. Hopefully, your stance is appreciated elsewhere.
A4: One of the best things we could do to reduce our carbon emissions is to do more to make our energy production emit less: continuing to produce nuclear energy until after 2022 could be very helpful in that regard. Leaving our power plants running is a dictate of reason - the nuclear phase-out has nothing to do with rationality, it’s ideology.
F4: If it’s an ideology, Merkel is a part of it, remember that - she continued the phase-out in 2011, after Fukushima. You’ve stayed consistent on this issue throughout your career, but most voters see the exit from nuclear as a done deal and think you’re beating a dead horse. Maybe when you’re chancellor you can change that.

Q19: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Most vulnerable groups have been taken care of, but some vaccine-critical or lethargic people have been on the holdout for their shot. Some media figures are now going as far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory. What do you think of this?
A1: A universal vaccine mandate has many ethical, constitutional and organizational Questions, that would have to be answered. Maybe a sort of staggered plan for group-based vaccine mandates could lead us to our goal. Certain institutions that have entered a duty to serve this country.
F1: You’re echoing the mainstream, a vast majority of Germans approve of this stance. A proposal similar to yours gains crosspartisan traction and is poised to pass in the coming months. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A2: While I wouldn’t go that far, as we might run into legal issues, we should give people more incentives to get vaccinated. One solution might be to open up certain establishments from the lockdown, but only for vaccinated and recovered people.
F2: This statement is received quite well overall and might actually make vaccinations more attractive. Sceptics still feel alienated - better hope they’ll return from the fringes soon. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A3: Covid is basically over, the case numbers are very low. I don’t see a problem in letting every citizen decide for themselves what is right for them, and I don’t think the state and health insurance necessarily should have to pay for those. Encroachments in our basic rights would have to be very thoroughly justified.
F3: Some perceive this as a certain dog whistle towards the <i> Querdenker</i>-anti-vax-movement. Your opponents start hitting you on your lax stance, and as usual, you refuse to apologize. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.
A4: This might be a good idea. The country needs to move on, we need to do everything we can to finally make Covid history. At some point, we need to have the conversation about mandatory vaccines, and fine those that refuse to get one. We all have a duty to lead this country through this dark time.
F4: Fair point, but compulsory vaccinations are generally unpopular, and some question if such a move is even legal - many of them in your own party. Like it or not, you are on the fringe of this debate. During all this, the SPD continues its unlikely surge that began during the floods, in a shake-up for the ages.

Q20: August 2020: The SPD has been surging in the polls, drawing votes from both you and the Green Party. Both parties want to claw their way back to the top - crossing paths with you. <br> As such, your political history has gotten a lot of attention - specifically, some votes you cast as an MP in the 90s, like voting against harder punishments for the rape of a spouse. As the campaign closes out, you’re repeatedly asked for a comment.
A1: I refuse to dignify this with a response. This is nothing but a smear campaign, and everyone attacking me knows this. I never voted against punishments for the rape of a spouse.
F1: You did vote like this, and this is too big an issue to wish away. By not providing any clarification to the claim at all, you give your opponents free reign to attack you and define you as out of touch. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A2: Now, I’m saying this clear and unmistakable: I never voted against the criminalization of rape in a marriage. Rape in marriage was already illegal, although under a different law, and I only voted against this because I wanted a slightly different law, that made it possible for the woman to stop the criminal proceedings.
F2: As much as you’re trying to finesse this, your long winded explanations are hard to explain to a layman, and the ‘objection clause’ you’re referring to was already controversial back then. The attacks don’t cease, but for some, you at least have the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A3: Me and many others had the fear that criminal proceedings based on marital disputes would harm the protective needs of affected women, so I was for an objection clause. Today, almost a quarter century later, I would decide differently. It was a different time, and we have all grown and learned since then.
F3: Your apology satisfied most journalists, but the discourse about your involvement in moral debates of the 90’s makes you sound out of touch regardless and fires up your opponents. At least you acknowledge that times have changed. Meanwhile, most voters have given the SPD another look.
A4: I stand by my vote. I don’t believe this change of law was necessary, and while this is settled law now, I personally don’t agree with the decision the parliament made - we shouldn’t reach into the realm of the personal with legal methods. The Federal courts have said as much: There’s no such thing as rape of a spouse.
F4: Friedrich, look. This court decision was in 1966. <i>1966!</i> Do you get it now? <br> Your own ‘personal realm’ is unsettled by your stance, but more so the media: the shitstorm just intensifies. Your team gets an apology out from you, but the polling leaves no other conclusion: You might’ve just committed political suicide.

EQ6: A bit of a minor issue, but one that has gripped the imagination of many young voters is the topic of cannabis. Currently, it is a controlled substance, and illegal to produce, distribute or own. In light of worldwide movements to decriminalize or even legalize it: <i>Wann Bubatz legal</i>?
A1: Cannabis is a societal reality, like alcohol. We should start to take steps towards a regulated distribution to adults, accompanied by addiction prevention measures. The possession of small amounts shouldn’t be prosecuted anymore.
F1: What a wildcard! This is a definitive change in pace for your party, who has advocated for a “drug free society” ever since its founding. This cautious pivot rankles moralists and the party base, particularly the CSU, but in other corners, your modernized stance is received with positive surprise.
A2: We are against the legalization of illegal drugs. The risks for the individual and society are too great - instead, we should work towards addiction prevention, as well as early and suitable sanctions, that incentivise taking counseling and therapy. We do acknowledge the medical usage of Cannabis, however.
F2: “Cannabis is no broccoli” as drug commissioner Daniela Bär succinctly said. The Union’s line remains unchanged even in the face of developing popular opinions. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - legalization is still very controversial, and concerned parents are happy to have someone on their side.
A3: Legalize it! We are for permitting the controlled distribution of Cannabis, through regulated sales in licenced shops. We do need projects to prevent drug abuse and youth protection though, financed through consumption taxes, as well as a legal framework around marihuana usage.
F3: Have you indulged yourself? To the CSU, it sounds like it: a public intraparty fight over drug policies ensues, and your CDU colleagues are hesitant to defend you, horrified themselves. Regardless of your personal stance, you’ve offended most of your voters for little gain and are forced to accept the restrictive party line in the end.
A4: What are these guys smoking? We need to further pursue drug users and lower the amount of cannabis that is legally prosecuted. Our goal is a drug free society. Look at the Netherlands, they have decriminalized the possession of just 5 grams, with fatal consequences - that won’t happen to our children!
F4: Ever the moral crusader. The cannabis question hasn’t been a particularly salient issue before, but by drawing the battle lines this clearly, you’ve dragged it somewhat of a limelight. The Greens and SPD vehemently oppose your harsh stance, and in verbal conflict, you’re certainly coming into your own - just hope the youth turnout won’t drown out your base.

Q21: There are 7 parties poised to enter parliament, and none has ever won an absolute majority since Adenauer in 1957. As such, it is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. You are asked ad-nauseam - who would you enter a coalition with?
A1: We will talk with all democratic parties - the SPD, the Greens and the FDP. However, I want to needle the leftist parties for not ruling out a coalition with the extremist Left. They are fringe populists, unfit to govern.
F1: The public seems to be on your side - pluralities or even majorities of people in polls seem to want Scholz and Baerbock to disavow the idea of Red-Red-Green, which they refuse to do. That said, you’re hit back on your soft stance towards the AfD, and although you clarify, you’re forced into the spotlight with it.
A2: We rule out coalitions with the extremes. Normally we would talk with everyone in the center, but it’s clear how a continuation of the Grand Coalition of the last 8 years would not have a public mandate. I am confident I could make the Union’s profile clear in a constellation with the Greens.
F2: Some question if the Union and SPD will even have a majority, though such a blanket statement leaves you with few options later on. The FDP is sympathetic to you, and the Greens were flattered when you offered something similar last year - better hope this campaign hasn’t soured them on the prospect of Jamaica.
A3: The last few years have shown how we can not ignore the 10-15% of the populace voting for the AfD. This country needs change and new solutions. I think a Bahamas coalition with the AfD and the FDP could work - Austria showed us how the right wing can govern harmonically.
F3: You have given credence to your biggest critics - the firewall against the right has been broken down. Your stance is poison to most voters, SPD and Greens rule out any cooperation with you, and even the FDP might be a hard sell now. The AfD, tempted by power, are alone in sympathizing with your overtures.
A4: I don’t think talking about majorities is what we should be doing during this campaign. After the elections, we will see what coalitions are mathematically possible and negotiate accordingly.
F4: It’s reasonable to keep your options open. That said, the media presses you on disavowing the radical poles, and you are doing that, but the fact that you had to clarify gives some of your opponents suspicions that this was a covert offer to the AfD…

EQ7: A defining social issue is the question of abortion. Currently, criminal law §218 disallows abortions generally, but decriminalizes them in case of rape, or if the pregnancy is under 12 weeks old. Additionally, §219a establishes an “ad ban” for doctors offering abortions. You’re asked for your stance on this controversial topic.
A1: While §218 is a settled compromise from our societal discussions, we are for striking the §219a ad ban: women who are deciding on an abortion need unrestricted access to information. We also need to train more doctors and prevent pressure from abortion opponents in front of clinics.
F1: How unexpected! Some journalists praise you for your progressive pivot, but most smell bitter opportunism in order to brush up your image with women. The Union, especially the CSU, is having none of it - while there are some who can see how §219a might be harmful, most don’t want to see you trivialize the right of the unborn like that.
A2: We want to strike $218, 219 and 219a from the books completely. Pregnancy issues are not part of criminal law - abortion is a medical service that has to be managed as part of regular health care. The stigma has to be broken, and the supply of doctors offering abortion has to be increased.
F2: There have been certain CDU politicians advocating against §218 all the way back in the ‘90s, people like Rita Süssmuth. They, however, have been repeatedly repudiated - and the same now happens to you. After you publicly have to elaborate your stance as a “third way” and reiterate personal moral objections, you’re in an awkward spotlight.
A3: The current situation is fine as is. Unborn life does have a right to be protected. Furthermore, the ad ban has already been loosened two years ago, to provide better access to information for affected women and legal certainty for doctors and hospitals, if an abortion is necessary.
F3: This is a fine answer that doesn’t make this a bigger issue than it is. Standing by classic conservative moralism and Merkel’s policies here is expected and applauded by family advocacy groups. Let’s focus your campaign on topics that matter more.
A4: The right to life does not stand to disposition. The unborn child has a right to live, and we stand vehemently against efforts to trivialize or encourage abortions from the state. Instead, adoption procedures should be simplified - while doctors who do not report abortions have to incur noticeable sanctions.
F4: Moral issues really weren’t at the forefront of this campaign, but your strong answer has taken the attention of the political landscape. Some of your language is taken straight from the AfD, and women's groups vehemently denounce you. They’ll support Baerbock anyways, so let’s hope there’s a silent majority for your stance.


Q22: September 2021: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. Many loyal locals are left behind, as the Taliban are poised to make a comeback. The government is sharply criticized for its botched evacuation - what stance do you want to take?
A1: This is a miscalculation from the government, but it’s clear that this was a misstep from all of NATO. The retreat of American troops was at fault here, and as have said in the past, we need to take more care of our own security here in Europe. We just can’t be as dependent on the US anymore.
F1: Your past comments concerned a partial withdrawal from US troops in Germany, but many silently agree with your position. It’s questionable though how much the rest of Europe is on board -  and the immediate criticism still falls onto your party, who is heading the government. Your status as an outsider does alleviate this a bit.
A2: It’s a disgrace how so many good people would now have to live under civil strife and a possible Taliban takeover. We have to measured of course, but we need to take in more refugees than we are right now, especially those who cooperated with our troops. We owe it to them for their service.
F2: The media debates if you had an epiphany or if you want to soften your image. Either way, this seems to be a change in directions, similar to the one Merkel had in 2015. The AfD immediately derides you as no better than her, you receive angry calls from some local supporters, and the left is confused.
A3: The foreign ministry under SPD control is clearly to blame for our part in this crisis. If it’s true Foreign Minister Maas has ignored advice from the embassy and the intelligence services, he should resign. His behavior and justifications are just embarrassing.
F3: Harsh words. The SPD immediately retorts by blaming the CDU-led defense ministry. Unproductive mudslinging ensues, with the most credible critique coming from the opposition. Merkel is displeased with the coalition's disunity so shortly before her reigns end, but you couldn’t care less.
A4: Despite the terrible pictures, the last thing we need now is more uncontrolled immigration. 2015 can not repeat itself. The consequences of the immigration wave are still not under control - the <i> Willkommenskultur </i> of Merkel was, in hindsight, a great political mistake.
F4: Ouch. You really seem to gamble that pivoting to immigration can return the AfD into your fold and conjure up a silent majority. You’re of course immediately jumped upon by left-wingers - but your base cheers you on, and even Merkel's Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, concurs with you. Hopefully this pays off.

Q23: September 2021: Official TV debates are a relatively recent phenomenon in Germany, only being consistently organized since 2002. Now, for the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Olaf Scholz and Annalena Baerbock are all invited. What is going to be your strategy?
A1: Olaf Scholz has been surging a lot in the polls recently and privately, I worry that he will not stop. We compete for a lot of voters with his wannabe-Merkel attitude - it seems foolish to do anything but attack him on his many weaknesses.
F1: It seems right now like Scholz has clawed his way back up top, so this seems like a prudent choice. Your advisors get out the oppo-research, now it’s up to you to stop his surge
A2: Baerbock has been struggling lately, but the Greens are still a strong party with a vulnerable candidate, and some voters we could pick up. Let’s focus on her.
F2: Her numbers keep slipping, but the Greens are still a formidable force. Someone has to sweep up the rest of those voters. Your advisors get out the oppo-research - Let’s hope you can make it count.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks. This isn’t America.
F3: An unusual approach for you, but maybe a calm pragmatic attitude can change some people's perceptions of you as a rightwing rabble rouser. People do like concrete solutions - let’s hope taking the high road helps you stand out and clarify what you’re really about!
A4: Actually, I don’t want two left-wing politicians to gang up on me. This format is not up to the times and I can guarantee, time will not be allotted fairly to the only conservative party at the table. Thus, I must decline this invitation.
F4: Many question your judgment. The debate goes ahead without you - and makes it look like Greens and SPD compete for the chancellery, with the CDU as a petty third wheel. Scholz goes on to edge out Baerbock, but the real loser by default is Friedrich Merz.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. There are plenty of avenues to attack him and stun his momentum - which talking points do you emphasize?
A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form a coalition with populist demagogues after the election?
F1: Scholz is in a bit of an awkward spot with this attack and doesn’t can’t give a clear answer. While Baerbock doesn’t either, she slips a bit under the radar - together they accuse you of piloting right-wing talking points yourself. Scholz’s momentum with the political center is stunted, but Baerbock seems unphased, winning her the debate.
A2: Let’s hit him on his scandals as finance minister. Under his watch, Wirecard collapsed due to fraudulent dealings and lots of people lost their money. We need to poke attention to the police raid on a government office belonging to his ministry - he refuses to take responsibility.
F2: A damaging attack, but both point out your opposition to a lobbying register and your ties to the private market. You try to justify yourself, but when Baerbock points out that you yourself have met with the Wirecard-boss to talk about “matters of general capital”, she delivers a coup de grace that wins her the whole thing.
A3: Scholz likes to pretend he’s a moderate, even Merkel-esque, but the candidate Scholz doesn’t want to fit his leftwing party. His claims of moderation not only ring farcical, they have been tried and tested in 20 of the last 24 years, and are part of what brought us here today. I can bring change, vice chancellor Scholz can’t.
F3: Baerbock tries to pivot to criticizing both parts of the Grand Coalition, but your status as an outsider and your confident resolve really sell your point. At first, your critique of Merkel is shocking and it’s unclear who came out on top, but as the media narrative develops, people are surprisingly intrigued by your performance.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - after giving my usual critiques of his party, I’ll just wing it and rely on my instincts as an outsider to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. You can’t recount many detailed policies, and get awfully defensive when asked about the rape-in-marriage matter. Scholz is seen as the Triell’s winner, but the attention is on your confused performance.

Q25: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Annalena Baerbock, chancellor candidate of the Greens. Earlier scandals have already hurt her campaign, and you may now deliver the coup de grace. What do you want to emphasize?
A1: She’s had problems with plagiarism in her book, and she inflated her CV. These might seem like minor things, but can she really be trusted to govern this country, if she fails at these minor tasks?
F1: Critics immediately deride you as sexist, but her favorability did go down in the wake of these issues, cynically. She gets defensive, as the debate turns toward statesmanship. Unfortunately, that’s not your strongest suit either, and numerous problematic comments from your past come up. Scholz meanwhile comes out mostly untouched.
A2: Everyone on this stage agrees that something has to be done about climate change, but what Mrs Baerbock and her party want can’t be the solution! We need to involve everyone, protect livelihoods and emphasize innovation, instead of blanket bans, as Mrs. Baerbock advocates.
F2: This devolves into a heated back and forth between the two of you on climate policy. Both of you are well versed in your ideological standpoints, and it devolves into a trench fight that riles up both your bases. Though it’s Olaf Scholz again, who manages to strike a healthy middle ground to take away a narrow win.
A3: I’ll attack her for her willingness to govern with the radical Left party. Moderates should be frightened by this prospect, there should be a firewall against Radicals of all stripes, and entertaining a coalition with the Left, as the Greens do, is irresponsible.
F3: It is a bit of a weak point for her, but most voters frightened by this prospect have already abandoned her campaign. In the end, it’s just posturing - that said, you’re good at that. She seems out of it, and while Scholz has a similar problem, you ignore each other mostly, landing in a tie. The duopoly reasserted itself, at least in the Triell.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. The mudslinging isn’t worth it - I’ll just broadly criticize Baerbock for her incompetence and then just wing it, relying on my instincts as an outsider to rise above the pack.
F4: You haven’t really prepared your talking points beforehand, and your instincts fail you. Your criticism of Baerbock is perceived as a sexist dog whistle, and you get awfully defensive about it. Baerbock is quite offended while Scholz has a good performance, but the attention is clearly on your gaffe-prone penchant.

Q26: During the Triell, you decided to take the high road, and focus on making your case to the German people without mudslinging. There are many policies in the CDU/CSU programs, and you can employ different strategies of presenting yourself to the audience. How do you want to do that?
A1: I want to present myself as a candidate for pragmatic solutions to climate change. We clearly have to be future-oriented: but what we need is breathing room for market innovation and international cooperation. I propose an overhaul of our economic policies - together we can modernize without unnecessary bans.
F1: Baerbock criticizes you sharply, and you are drawn into back-and-forths on her environmental turf after all. Overall, Scholz ducks the shootout and comes out victorious.
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason.They want to raise taxes on the ordinary citizen and spend more money on every little pet project - I stand for an optimistic outlook on our economy, tax cuts, bureaucracy reform, fiscal responsibility and modern innovation.
F2: With two leftwingers ganging up on you, you do manage to catch some sympathy as an outsider. You cleverly convince voters to worry about how Scholz and Baerbock want to pay for their proposals - and all the while, you seem reasonable to the audience at home. Against all odds, you win this debate.
A3: This country is in need of fresh leadership. After 16 years of Merkel and the Grand coalition, I’m the right man for the change this country needs. We need to modernize this economy and lead this country responsibly into the 21st century, with a new style of governance.
F3: You frame the debate in terms of modernization, and Scholz, as incumbent vice chancellor, looks uncomfortable. You make a good case for yourself, but Baerbock is both younger and a member of a party that hasn’t governed for 16 years. A Green chancellor is still an exciting prospect to many, and she capitalizes.
A4: Actually, screw this! I know they won’t hold back, so I won’t either. We have enough ammunition to show Baerbocks and Scholz’ incompetence, and I shouldn’t be afraid to use it. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You go on to contradict yourself in front of Scholz on Wirecard and dish out alleged sexist dog whistles against Baerbock. Stuff like this isn't unheard from you, but you seem to have affirmed many people’s fears about you. <i>Die Bild</i> calls you the <i>Chaos-Chancellor</i>. In a final slight, Scholz is praised as Merkel-esque.

EQ8: Along with the <i> Triell </i>, another TV debate is commonly held among surrogates of the smaller parties; the so-called <i>Vierkampf</i>. While the Greens have seemingly eclipsed the other Bundestag parties, it’s Janine Wissler of Die Linke, Christian Lindner of the FDP, Alice Weidel of the AfD and Alexander Dobrindt of the CSU, the smaller sister of the Union, debating about the issues of the day.
A1: Let's hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F1: Not many people watch the debate, but this year, it was surprisingly lively. For those that did, it's agreed that Wissler made some good points about wealth inequality and social justice – unfortunately, this could prove decisive for Die Linke to enter the Bundestag once again, counter to prior hopes.
A2: Let’s hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F2: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it's agreed that Lindner proved his rhetorical talent in talking about digitalization and fiscal responsibility. If the FDP matches or surpasses their performance from 2017, they might be an important partner in coalition talks for you.
A3: Let’s hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F3: Not many people watch the debate, but for those that did, it’s agreed that Alexander Dobrindt made a surprisingly strong case for you as the heir to Merkel’s Germany. This might help the CSU solidify its historical dominance in Bavaria, but it also garners some goodwill for you.
A4: Let’s hope Mr. Dobrindt makes a good impression for the Union cause.
F4: Not many people watch the debate, but in the following days people get more attentive, as the media observes how Alice Weidel surprisingly stunned her opponents with her points on Covid lockdowns and the political status quo. This might drive more disaffected people to the AfD, once and for all solidifying them on the right edge of German politics…

Q27: The 26th of September is almost here. Finally, this historically important campaign is coming to an end. Hopefully, you can lead the country into a post-Merkel-era! In your final lap for this year, you have a chance to get some support from a political ally. Who do you want to campaign with?
A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Armin Laschet to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously - the CDU is the party of reason, and I’m proud to stand with him for competent governance!
F1: Laschet, while not uncontroversial on the trail, excites the Merkel-wing of the party for your candidacy - you manage to showcase your statesmanship, particularly to your shared home state of North Rhine Westphalia. Now, it’s time to come home to Arnsberg - let’s hope you can lead Germany through “New Times - New Responsibilities”.
A2: Who else but Chancellor Angela Merkel could be the right person? She is a figure larger than life, a great icon to many, and although we did have our differences in the past, if she embraces me as her successor, we can win off her popularity.
F2: She is still popular, and appearing with her could give some credence to you being the rightful heir of this era - however, her schedule conflicts with yours, and she ‘has to refuse’. You might have to go it alone - but you’re used to this. Now, time to come home to Arnsberg - let’s hope you can lead Germany through “New Times - New Responsibilities”.
A3: It’s clear, many people have been forgotten over the last quarter century - and I have to take them back into the fold. The AfD could take first place in some East German states, and direct mandates could go to them: I need to campaign there with local partymen like Haselhof and Kretschmer.
F3: The firewall against the right wing is defended in the east, it seems. There’s nothing left but hope that you did enough to give AfD voters a reason to come back to the center. Now, time to come home to Arnsberg - let’s hope you can lead Germany through “New Times - New Responsibilities”.
A4: Markus Söder and I didn’t always have the warmest relationship, but there is a reason he gave me such a scare - the man has charisma. Let’s campaign with him in Bavaria and show some unity between the CDU and CSU.
F4: Söder is popular, but a bit unenthused - He nonetheless urges for unity and campaigns with you in his home state. Although you can’t tell what’s behind those power hungry eyes, he does gift you a nice Lederhosen. Now, time to come home to Arnsberg - let’s hope you can lead Germany through “New Times - New Responsibilities”.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Mitte
EQ8: Up until now, you have seemingly defused your rhetoric a bit, embracing a classical moderate-conservative Christian Democracy, mostly following the center-right party doctrine. Some advisors want you to pivot further left towards the median voter, while others want you to take the AfD’s wind out of their sails. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand by my issues, I am a proud Christian Democrat, you know that. However, we are competing with two left-wing alternatives- in order to win a strong mandate, we need to move leftwards, toward the center, as much as I despise it.
F1: A classic electoral tactic - but your pivot makes you uncomfortable, and it subtly shows. Your party base isn’t as energized as it used to be - but if you keep them from voting for the AfD, there’s not much competition for you. Let’s hope your gamble can pay off…
A2: The CDU is the party of the center. We have done a great job at governing over the last 16 years, and while we need to move into the future, our future is a Christian-Democratic one. I stand by my course.
F2: Your framing satisfies everyone in the room and isn’t out of character for you. Nodding to each side of the aisle keeps your party united and conflict-free - a nice contrast to your past combative behavior. You see a small rise in your favorability.
A3: I have been voted in by a particular base - Merkel-sceptic conservatives. The chancellor has become popular with voters of the other parties - for us, some of her policies are a bit more controversial. On these issues, we definitely need to move rightwards - to provide for a real alternative to the Greens and SPD.
F3: The word “alternative” isn’t lost to your advisors, and the return to your conservative bonafides does solidify your right flank. The fact that you have less competition on this side of the spectrum might have you coming out in first place by default - but there are significant internal grumblings about your warring with Merkel, leaking out into the press.

CDU Course-Correction wenn Rechts
EQ9: Up until now, your campaign has been met with a noticeable hardline-conservative tone,  seemingly wanting to take the party rightwards. You clearly evoke the CDU pre-Merkel, that you represent. In an internal meeting, you’re asked frankly: do you plan to keep this up?
A1: I stand for what I think is right, but it’s become clear to me we need to defuse ourselves. Let’s reconcile with the more leftwards elements of the party - so that they won’t defect to the Liberals, or even our opponents.
F1: You haven’t had the best relationship with your party’s left, and they have been bleeding in enthusiasm or even silently defecting to the FDP and other opponents. Your efforts could prevent the worst - but you risk coming off as a flip-flopper, an opportunist without principles.
A2: Yes. I stand for what I believe is right in this country, and it’s clear how we need a change in attitude in Germany to stay competitive. Our standing in the world is decreasing, and we need to work towards improving our country to be the best it can be, because we are patriots.
F2: Patriotism has been a dodgy topic in Germany since the end of the war - but mostly on the left anyway. When you hold a speech the next day echoing your stance, you energize your supporters, turn some heads in the AfD and reap the approval of your eastern state parties. Merkel-loving centrists are irritated by your grandstanding, but they’re just noise.
A3: Look - chancellor Merkel is a competent woman who I respect. But the fact of the matter is, her policies have tilted leftwards, both socially and economically. What our country needs in the post-Merkel era are policies more in line with conservative doctrines - the AfD’s success has shown that. If anything, we need to come back to our roots and move this country to the right.
F3: Your biting ideological stance as well as your outright Merkel critiques leak out to the press - but people are used to it by now. Keep in mind, Merkel is still more popular than you: Greens and SPD immediately shoot back, even almost defending the chancellor - and getting more and more wary about working with you in a potential coalition agreement.



A4: While the results in Saxony-Anhalt are definitely praiseworthy, me and my surrogates should focus on Baerbock’s scandals. We’re running a national campaign - and directly dealing with our opponent might be better.
F4: You keep the attention on Baerbocks scandals - finally a break in the Greens unlikely surge. That said, you could also push voters away from your own successes - depending on how you frame your attacks.
