Q66: The Alternative für Deutschland (AfD, “Alternative For Germany”) has grown rapidly since its founding in 2013. Originally a eurosceptic party, they were swept into parliament four years ago as a reaction to 2015, concurrent with nationalist backlashes all over Europe. Many people are toxic towards the new party, earnestly comparing them to the Nazi-movement, but others, especially East Germans, feel drawn to them nonetheless. As the Union’s candidate, how do you plan to win them back?
A1: The AfD found its success primarily on the back of our parties veering leftwards under Merkel. By taking their concerns seriously and pivoting back rightward on social and economical issues, we can position ourselves as the only electable conservative option for the right wing.
F1: This is the argument that many members of the “Werte-Union” make. Your stance could be successful on the fringes of moderate AfD voters, but that wing of the party is quickly dying in favor of the more hardline, populist “Flügel”, primarily made up of former non-voters - legitimizing their points rhetorically might actually help them in the end.
A2: It’s a populist movement. Who voted for Hitler? Right, the jobless. These people feel like the system has failed them personally, so they turn away from it. By producing good policies, creating jobs and furthering our prosperity we can restore the trust in the economic and individual potential of Germany, and thus, relegitimize our system.
F2: This rhetoric doesn’t make much waves and is of moderate success. There’s simply not much you could do about this before the election. Your stance might prove useful in the long run though - if you’re serious. Keep in mind many of their voters tend to belong to lower classes, so the wealth has to trickle down to them.
A3: Helmut Kohl was a great man, but privately, we have to admit, the reunification of Germany has failed in many parts. We need a new culture of respect towards East Germany, to show presence and listen to them, to get more East German politicians into the limelight. That way, we’ll take the AfD’s base right from under their feet.
F3: With many visits in the “new States” and a renewed focus on your East German state parties, your strategy receives moderate success! While it will take much more than that to knock the AfD out, your polling in East Germany improves, at the cost of both them and even a few “ostalgic” Left voters.
A4: This semi-fascist party likes to complain, but they have no answers themselves. We need to vehemently denounce their xenophobic, even antisemitic tendencies, while showing off just how hollow their program is. We won’t stoop down to their level and compromise our values. They don’t want to do politics, they want to destroy democracy.
F4: The moral high ground, indeed. While it keeps the AfD from expanding further into your base, and upholds your unwavering firewall against the Right, attacking them doesn’t really convince any of their current voters. They know about the hollowness of their policies, they’re just too frustrated to care. In fact, the Far Right just seems to be more energized.

A2: It’s a disgrace how so many good people would now have to live under civil strife and a possible Taliban takeover. We need to take in more refugees from Afghanistan, especially people who cooperated with the German troops. We owe it to them, after their generous help!
F2: You keep unwavering in your support of refugees. Your party isn’t fully on board, especially Horst Seehofer, who refuses to make statements in support of you. The AfD salivates at rural voters who are frightened of your love for asylum seekers - but you are respected in more culturally progressive circles.
[+0.003 für CDU, -0.002 für Grüne]
A4: Okay, uh… one thing’s clear, we can’t have a repeat of the refugee crisis in 2015. Let’s tell them, we are watching the situation closely, but we concur with Interior Minister Horst Seehofer that criminal refugees still have to be sent back to Afghanistan, with a zero-tolerance policy.
F4: After your positive statements about refugees earlier in the campaign, this type of statement is just not credible. Progressives perceive you as ice-cold and opportunistic in the wake of a coming Taliban takeover, while conservatives are doubtful about your sincerity. Not a good look for you.

F2: Your sentiment is appreciated by some, but after you toughened up on refugees earlier in the campaign, this is a bit of a flip-flop. Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is disappointed by your pivot and lets the public know. The cultural left meanwhile isn’t particularly convinced that you’re for real.

F4: You’re consistent in your newfound hard line on refugees. It does give you some credibility with the right wing of your party and some AfD voters. However, being a trailblazer for the Cultural Right doesn’t just do you favors, it also amps up the opposition to your candidacy from the left, which might complicate coalition talks.

It hasn’t helped you before - and although your proposal isn’t unpopular, the majority of people who haven’t had a chance to get vaccinated yet aren’t thrilled - mostly younger voters.

F1: The audience cheers you on, as spending more on defense is always popular in more conservative circles.

This is a usual attack against them, but even though they seem to move right on defense, it still seems to hit the spot after some of Baerbocks statements on the 2%-goal - although it should be said that you’ve criticized the USA as well, earlier this year.

He and Baerbock vehemently criticize you on empowering fascists and win the debate by a landslide, in what proves to be a humiliating affair for you.

STATESMANSHIP
Statesman >15

EQ99: Over the course of this campaign, you have stood steadfast, like a rock in the waves, in support of Angela Merkel and her 16 year long chancellorship. You’ve essentially run as Merkel’s successor, but you’ve also carved out an identity for yourself, exuding competency, authenticity and integrity. At the end of this race, several conservative op-eds point you out as the single most capable man to safeguard Germany’s prosperity, and it resonates with swing voters.
A1: We have to speak clearly, but not polarize. We have to integrate, keeping our society together, bringing different people together. That's hard work; one has to do a lot of listening, also listening to uncomfortable things. But at the end of the day, we have to seek compromise, to find solutions that the people demand from us. That's what I mean, when I say, 'let's keep it up'!
F1: While others stand for radical change, you are the epitome of a statesman, a fixpoint for stability. There’s still a good chunk of voters who like Merkel’s Germany - Merkel herself even goes as far as to proclaim in an interview: “I don’t see any differences between Armin Laschet and myself”. Not a bad thing, considering her approval rating of 70%.

F3: The thing is, the situation for the Union is more dire than ever before. A win through plurality is still a win, but you’re poised to achieve the worst result of the CDU in history. Your colleagues demand a more impressive mandate than this - hopefully you can deliver.

A2: I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to take the climate more seriously. Let’s unveil some of our own environmental policies to stop their momentum and defuse some of their criticisms.
F2: This seems like an appropriate move, applauded by many. You seem to follow Söders tactic of modernizing the Union’s image on conservationism - just beware of your climate-suspicious rural base. They still need a reason to vote for you over radical alternatives.

A1: It is important that we don’t demonize Putin and keep our dialogue open. I’m critical of many things the Russian leadership has done, but overall, we should strive to cooperate with them, as we do on the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F1: This sentiment is popular especially in East Germany. Seeing as how the CDU is traditionally more hawkish, there seems to be a paradigm shift - although people doubt you have the political acumen to deal with Putin, patronizingly calling you a <i>Putinversteher</i>...

A2: I’ve been more lenient in the past, but enough is enough. I will join in with the criticism against Kretschmer and call for a tougher stance towards Putin. Maybe we should only open the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline if we get some concessions from Russia.
F2: Considering your past statements, this is a bit of a flip-flop and might be perceived as conflict-happy. Kretschmer picks a small fight with you, and as Söder also had a trip to Russia, some take this as a slight towards him. That said, this is an appropriate red line to many - hopefully the intra-party spat doesn’t overshadow this…
