CDU-Laschet

Q1: January 2021: The CDU is looking for a new party leader at their party congress after the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. After passing up a bid in the former contest in 2018, you feel like now is the time to strike. How do you want to convince the delegates to vote for you instead of Friedrich Merz or Norbert Röttgen?
A1: I am Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state in Germany. None of my opponents has held a political office in the last few years - I will bring my expertise to the national level.
F1: Although you eschew ideology, competence is a great argument and the reason why you were drafted in the first place. With no majority on the first ballot, you win against Merz on the second ballot.
A2: Out of the three candidates nominated, I am the only one who has actually won an election and in a former SPD-stronghold nonetheless. It is crucial that we win the Bundestagswahl this fall, and I am the right man to do it!
F2: Both Merz and Röttgen have been out of politics for a bit and haven’t proven their electability. With the CDU eager for a continuation of their dominance, you almost clinch the nomination on the first ballot and easily win the second.
A3: I am more conservative than Röttgen and more liberal than Merz. By positioning myself between those two, I will draw votes from whoever is knocked out on the first ballot and win on the second ballot.
F3: Elections are won in the centre! While the party is not all that enthusiastic about you, you really do win on the second ballot against Merz, with Röttgens endorsement. Be sure to talk some straight talk though, lest your base asks for a stronger man to become chancellor…
A4: The party officials are largely behind me. They should push for me behind closed doors to make sure I win this contest. I will already focus on convincing swing voters for the election.
F4: Remember your poster from 2017: “The big whole starts with an ear for the smaller things”. While you’re perceived as arrogant and complacent, Friedrich Merz rises from the ashes as a “man of the people”. He beats you narrowly, and you can only watch from the sidelines as he tries to become chancellor this fall.

Q2: Congratulations, you are now party leader of the Christian Democratic Union. You are not the official chancellor candidate of the Union of CDU and CSU yet, but hopefully, that will just be a formality. What will be your emphasis in your work for the party?
A1: I want to continue the legacy of the Merkel-era as much as possible. Her sixteen years of chancellorship were outstanding, and I promise to continue on that course.
F1: Adenauer's spirit praises you: “No experiments!” Angela Merkel is a popular chancellor and holds significant respect for middle-of-the-road voters. However, some perceive a certain stagnation in government in the last few years. Be sure to provide some vision for the future, or you won’t win anyone under the age of 50.
A2: The CDU is the party for the middle of society. I will continue moving the party into the future, with a moderate and pragmatic course on the issues of the day.
F2: Right-wing culture warriors have already bled to the AfD, but your course does not convince them to come back. That said, you might not need them if you convince enough non-ideological voters of the need for stability - a big electoral prize in Germany.
A3: The strong showing of Merz has shown that the right wing of the party has too often been ignored by Merkel. Under my leadership, we will bring the party back on a more conservative path.
F3: After the leadership contest, mainstream media wonders why you’re caving so much. That said, taking back frustrated culture warriors might be good to keep the extreme right small, and your base certainly is excited. Be careful with your rhetoric though - lest you imitate them too much for the average voter.
A4: I want to single out climate change as the most important issue facing our society in the coming years. It is important that we don’t leave this topic to other parties, but present solutions of our own.
F4: “Laschets left-wing pivot”, the headline of <i>Der Spiegel </i> reads. That’s not necessarily meant as an insult - many outsiders tentatively praise your new outlook. It’s insiders though who worry that you’ve gone woke, especially in your sister party, the CSU. The AfD salivates at you leaving your right wing open to attacks.

Q3: March 2021: COVID-19 has shaped the lives of people in Germany and across the world for the past years. Now that the winter is over, a lot of people are demanding an end to the harsh lockdowns. As Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, you could chart a new course for your government. What is your stance on this?
A1: While the lockdowns were the right thing to do, now that the winter is over and we have started to vaccinate people, it is time to return to normalcy. North Rhine-Westphalia will open up quickly.
F1: Your approach backfires. As soon as the climate warms, cases are surging again, and you face harsh critiques for your carelessness. Political opponents from your left criticize you sharply, as does famous virologist Christian Drosten.
A2: The situation is still very volatile and it is better to be cautious than reckless. We should keep the lockdowns for the foreseeable future, and only open up on strict criteria.
F2: At first, people are grumbling, but when cases start to surge again in the spring, this looks like a good call. Not all are satisfied though - some view prolonged lockdowns as unconstitutional, especially in East Germany.
A3: While I’m all for opening up, we should keep an eye on the number of infected people and have a bridge lockdown during Easter if the case numbers become too high.
F3: You manage well enough, but with your wishy-washy rhetoric, you come off as a bit too much of a people-pleaser. You perceive a hit in your statewide favorability for your lack of vision and communication.
A4: This is a decision that the federal government and the states have to make together. I will wait and see what this process achieves and go with the majority opinion.
F4: People expect more leadership from a supposed future chancellor. While the measures are effective at keeping Covid at bay, and local outlets do give credit, this allows other political actors to outshine you - both inside and outside your party.

Q4: You’ve been invited to a talk show to talk about tax policy and the “Black Zero”, which mandates a balanced budget. The left and left-of-centre seeks more investments, paid for by taxing the rich, while the FDP seeks widespread tax reductions. How do you want to frame the position of your party?
A1: Under no circumstances will we raise taxes, but we don’t want to dramatically lower them. We will phase out the extra tax of the Soli and try to reduce the burden on small and medium-income earners while always keeping the budget balanced, in keeping with the “Black Zero”.
F1: This is your expected position, and your colleague, former Minister of Finance and current President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Black Zero”, thanks you in private. These proposals aren’t exactly unpopular, but a visionary you are not.
A2: The Covid crisis has left a massive hole in our budget that we have to plug somehow. We have to be measured, but a tax increase will likely be necessary to avoid any unnecessary debts.
F2: A brutally honest answer, but honesty isn’t always well received, as the FDP and AfD make hay from disappointed market liberals. Leftists aren’t going to vote for you on that promise either. You should probably tread more lightly with unpopular policies so shortly before the election, much as your heart might be in the right place.
A3: Taxes for private households should stay where they are or even be lowered by phasing out the Soli. More importantly, corporate taxes should be lowered to unleash the full economic potential of this country. As little State as necessary, as much market as possible.
F3: A change from your usual positions, but an inspiring message to campaign on. It does keep economically-focused voters in your camp instead of the FDP’s - keep in mind you will need them if you are inclined to push through these policies. Your colleague, Former Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble, architect of the “Black Zero”, fears more state debt.
A4: To stimulate the economy after the Covid crisis, taxes have to be lowered across the board for both private households and corporations. We also have to streamline tax bureaucracy, maybe looking at a flat tax.
F4: It’s not a bad line persé, but to many, you sound more like a caricature of the FDP or Friedrich Merz - and even he criticized flat tax proposals in the early 2000’s. This is kind of a flip-flop and you’re just not the right person to sell this position in this day and age. Even party insiders deride you as naive behind closed doors.

Q5: Shook to your core, you read the headline of the 11/2021 issue of<i> Der Spiegel. “‘Schwarzer Filz’ - Mask deals, venality, failure in crisis: the deep fall of the Union”. </i> They reveal how several CDU/CSU MPs are implicated as part of a corrupt scheme to sell overpriced medical masks to government organizations. Journalists run in your door.
A1: I was as shocked as everyone else when I found out about this! The parliamentary immunity of these MPs should promptly be removed so they can be properly investigated. Corruption has no place in the CDU/CSU!
F1: Some wonder if corruption really has no place in your party, seeing how deep the connections lay, but the media praises you for your strong and steadfast response. Some in your party are nervous about how fast you were to drop your colleagues just like that.
A2: Let’s wait and see how this develops. I’ll issue a brief statement that we want to wait until it’s clear what actually happened.
F2: Journalists keep heckling you for more of a comment - this comes off as very suspicious, especially as more and more of these corrupt dealings come to light. When even your son is implicated, you seem to fail your first big challenge as party leader.
A3: This is nothing but a political hit job by a left-wing magazine in an election year. I’m sure further investigations will prove the innocence of these MPs.
F3: Look, <i>Der Spiegel </i>isn’t The Jacobin. Nobody is buying this, as the report is well sourced and new details come out almost every day. This makes you seem very out of touch with the public mood; some right-wingers tentatively praise you, but the AfD more so seeks to profit from government corruption.
A4: Let us be pragmatic. Two of our MPs may have indeed shown low moral inhibitions, but we shouldn’t judge the whole party based on the actions of two people. We support this investigation as much as anyone else, these are individual black sheep.
F4: At first, your argument seems solid and your base cheers you on - but with time, more and more people, including your own son, are implicated in similar dealings, as your line of defence weakens. You better work on changing the subject.

Q6: April 2021: Minister of Finance and current Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been declared chancellor candidate by the SPD last year already and there are rumours the Green party is about to nominate either Annalena Baerbock or Robert Habeck soon. Do you want to formally declare your candidacy before they do?
A1: This seems like a good time to declare my candidacy, yes. Though before I declare, I will call Markus Söder, the party leader of our sister party, the CSU, to make sure he won’t oppose me.
F1: To your surprise, man of power Markus Söder tells you he wants to become the candidate for the CDU/CSU as well. You both make your intentions public on the same day - and his favorability seems better than yours. This might become ugly…
A2: Yes, I will inform the upper party echelons and formally announce this during a press conference in my home state. There is no time to lose!
F2: Journalists are surprised by what seems like a hasty announcement, but this move was expected at some point. Surprisingly, Markus Söder, leader of the CSU, declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union as well, some days later. At least it looks like you have a small headstart.
A3: You know, it might be better to wait this out a bit longer. I can declare after whatever announcement the Green party makes to get them out of the limelight.
F3: This backfires when the leader of your sister party and enjoyer of the spotlight Markus Söder declares his intention to become the chancellor candidate for the Union the next day after. You’re taken by surprise and quickly follow suit, but this doesn’t make you look good, especially since Söder is quite popular.

Q7: You and Söder both want to become the chancellor candidate for the Union of CDU/CSU. Both of you have supporters and detractors within the party. How do you want to decide this?
A1: Actually, I thought about this long and hard, and I want to retract my candidacy. Söder has better polling numbers, many of our party members support him and I’m quite happy here serving as Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia.
F1: Söder is both surprised and grateful. You help him out for the rest of the campaign from the sidelines, and your move is called a humble, but necessary one, as he puts up hell of a fight for the election, “So Germany Stays Stable”.
A2: Let’s call every big name in the party, curry every favour maybe we can even get Merkel herself to weigh in. I can’t have this decided by vote, I want this decided by the party elites now.
F2: After several tense days, former Finance Minister and respected eminence Wolfgang Schäuble intervenes on your behalf. With his help, you convince party leadership to declare you as their candidate. Söder is pissed though, and you stand there looking like a coward. Now the pressure is on you to deliver on your slogan: “Making Germany Together”.
A3: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F3: While this is true, a lot of people in the CDU also preferred Söder, taken by his machismo and apparent electability. In somewhat of an upset, you narrowly lose the vote and have to have to cheer on Söder for the rest of the campaign. Your career is probably in jeopardy, but he sure puts up a hell of a fight on the campaign trail.
A4: The party parliamentary group of CDU and CSU shall vote on this. I’m confident they will pick me over Söder - his support primarily comes from Bavaria and I have the traditional prerogative as leader of the bigger party.
F4: While the vote is closer than you’d like, in the end, you come out victorious and vindicated. Söder accepts the outcome and both of you move on to focus on the upcoming campaign. This whole ordeal rankled some party members though, and your polling is lower than Söders hypotheticals. Now, let’s prove them wrong, “Making Germany Together”!

Q8: Wow, that was a close one! First, let’s take a breath.
Now, you have finally jumped the last hurdle and formally became the chancellor candidate of the CDU/CSU. What talking point do you want to hit on at the press conference?
A1: First and foremost, I want to thank Markus Söder for accepting the result. We have to be united as a party to win this fall. Apart from that, I will hit my usual talking points, about stability, pragmatism, praising Merkel and acting on our values.
F1: Party unity is always necessary, and being nice to Söder will help you among his supporters. Your speech comes to no surprise and doesn’t rock the boat, but it serves as a good rallying cry for anyone who might vote for the Christian Democrats.
A2: This closer-than-expected contest has convinced me that I need to move my position and change my attitude on some topics. I’ll focus on how dealing with the pandemic and not opening up too quickly is of critical importance, how we need strong leadership in these trying times and new ideas to move forward, to build on Angela Merkel's successes.
F2: Trying to capitalize on the winds of change, are we? It’s obvious to onlookers that you’re trying to take a page from Markus Söder’s playbook and some pundits mock you on these pivots, but he did seem to hit a nerve with this rhetoric. Let’s hope emulating him reaps you similar poll numbers.
A3: I will give a largely non-political speech. We need to focus on the importance of cohesion and trust in our society, to come together as one in the wake of this crisis, not letting our different views divide us, and the values of hard work. I want to bring up the anecdote about my father, who was a miner.
F3: Admirable sentiments, but a bit meandering. Anyone could have given this speech, and it doesn’t show how you are the candidate to deliver on this. Casting a broad net is good, but this one’s stretching it a bit too thin maybe - pundits keep debating on what your actual government would look like.
A4: Now is the perfect opportunity to emphasize that this country is in dire need of change and a new direction, away from the Status Quo. I will promise to modernize Germany while letting our values guide us in this progress. A new Germany, responsible, sensible and conservative.
F4: You’re right, many people demand change - but you certainly weren’t elected on this premise. The CDU has been in government for almost 16 years now, and Merkel’s allies are lukewarm about your newfound criticism of the Germany she has shaped so thoroughly. It’s doubtful how effective this argument can be from your mouth.

Q9: The Green party has, for the first time in its history, nominated a chancellor candidate, Annalena Baerbock. In a development few would have expected four years ago, she appears to be your main contender, even polling ahead of you sometimes, while Olaf Scholz of the SPD is far behind in third place. What’s your strategy regarding your two opponents?
A1: The Green party is always surging a few months before elections and comes crashing down in time, just like in 2011 after Fukushima. I’m not too worried - we should still focus more on competing with the SPD, our traditional opponent.
F1: Maybe you’re onto something, after all, the duopoly of CDU and SPD has held for over 70 years - but dismissing Baerbock seems foolish right now, considering the Greens currently poll much higher than at any point in their history. Perhaps you know something the media does not?
A2: I will take this development very seriously, clearly the demand is there to take the climate more seriously. Let’s unveil some of our own environmental policies to stop their momentum and defuse some of their criticisms.
F2: By and large, voters trust the Green party more on these issues, but providing concrete answers helps clarify the record and modernize your image. Söder has tried this before to much praise - just beware of your rural conservative base. There are some with whom these measures are unpopular, and they need a reason to vote for you over radical alternatives.
A3: Off the record, it’s not the worst thing that these two parties compete for centre-left votes. This makes the path to first place a lot easier. Let’s focus somewhat on the Greens as our main contender in that regard, and just attack them where we can.
F3: You’re probably right, but don’t get complacent: you are vying for swing voters with both parties and have lost some ground yourself recently. By keeping Conservatives and Merkel-approvers together, you can come up on top by default. You will probably need one of those parties in your coalition though.
A4: Actually, this is a bit ridiculous and reminds me of the publicity stunt the FDP pulled in 2002 when they nominated Guido Westerwelle as chancellor candidate. Let’s mock them for their hubris and don’t refer to Baerbock as a legitimate chancellor candidate.
F4: This seems very petty, somewhat desperate, even sexist, seeing how Baerbock is the only woman polling that high right now - the media isn’t slow to call you out on this. Also, you might need the Greens as a coalition partner later on, making fun of them like this won’t make you any friends.

Q10: Michael Kretschmer, your party colleague and Minister-President of Saxony, has recently travelled to Moscow and has been criticized for that visit. What’s your stance on Germany’s relationship with Russia and Putin?
A1: It is important that we don’t demonize Putin and keep our dialogue open. I’m critical of many things the Russian leadership has done, but overall, we should strive to cooperate with them, as we do on the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline.
F1: You are disparagingly called “Putin understander” by some, though especially in East Germany this position is quite popular. Seeing as how the CDU is traditionally more hawkish, some perceive a certain paradigm shift.
A2: I’ve been more lenient in the past, but enough is enough. I will join in with the criticism against Kretschmer and call for a tougher stance towards Putin. Maybe we should only open the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline if we get some concessions from Russia.
F2: Considering your past statements, this is a bit of a flip-flop and might be perceived as conflict-happy. With public opinion on this matter divided, you have cast your dies very clearly. Polish politicians praise you on social media -  let’s hope you can unite the rest of Europe as chancellor on this topic.
A3: Kretschmer is completely right, we have to talk more with Russia, not less. I’m all in favour of more dialogue and stronger economic ties with Russia. Besides, it’s not like the USA has never done anything wrong.
F3: For the majority of people, this is viewed as too lenient towards Russia. Criticizing the transatlantic partnership is also not really in line with your party, longtime americanophile Angela Merkel refuses to comment. At least Gerhard Schröder agrees with you on principle, but don’t expect many SPD voters to cross over on this issue alone.
A4: This whole thing is overblown, this trip was mostly for cultural exchange. I don’t have much to say about this. We stand on our commitment to Nato.
F4: As much as you might want to, this issue isn’t going away, and you haven’t really pleased anyone with this statement. Your commitment to Nato comes to no surprise and doesn’t register. Don’t be shy to show more backbone!


Q11: May 2021: A bombshell has rocked the Grand Coalition: the Federal Constitutional Court just ruled the Climate Protection Act unconstitutional and demands the government do more to lower emissions. Berlin has already gone to work on making the law stricter. What is your opinion on this issue?
A1: This was a bad decision by the court. The Climate Protection Act already went far enough and I’m not in favour of hurting the economy with a strict climate policy.
F1: This is somewhat out of touch with the country’s mood. You give a great soundbite to Green criticism, and make some waves in the media. Even some within your party can read the room, and the new law must comply with the decision either way. At least the AfD doesn’t have anything to gripe about you on this.
A2: It is important that we quickly implement the new law. I’m especially in favour of a price for CO<sub>2</sub> that is formed by market forces. We have to make sure that everyone can keep affording their energy bills, though, and we need to use this opportunity to create new jobs.
F2: You strike a good balance between acknowledging the need to do more and taking the worries of many citizens seriously. This mix of policies plays well in less affluent regions while not aggravating environmentalists.
A3: We have to become carbon neutral long before 2050. I’m sure the government under Merkel will come up with a sensible solution, which I will continue as chancellor.
F3: A fairly vague answer. You tie yourself to Merkel, but others make more waves by commenting more strongly.
A4: With the decision by the court, we now have a great opportunity for an ambitious new Climate Protection Act. I advocate for Germany to be carbon neutral by 2040 and to accelerate the transition to renewable energies. We simply can’t wait anymore.
F4: Potential Green voters like this approach - the new CDU really seems to take the climate more seriously. Coalition talks with the Greens now ought to be easier. Your own base is unnerved though; what about all the jobs in traditional industry, and what about the energy prices?

Q12: More and more people are receiving a Covid vaccine, though not everyone has been granted access yet. Older people are starting to get the shot, while some who are younger are frustrated to wait. Do you have a comment on how to move forward with the vaccination campaign?
A1: We need to open up quickly for vaccinated people. A return to normalcy has never been so close, and we all had more than enough of lockdowns - not every measure might still be proportionate. Vaccinated people have less risk and thus should receive more benefits.
F1: While this stance has its appeals, the majority of people who haven’t had a chance to get vaccinated yet aren’t thrilled - mostly younger voters. Also, some think this might cause a wedge in society, with a certain air of segregation. It is a good compromise if you think opening up is necessary, though.
A2: We are currently in a very critical phase of the pandemic, a phase in which cohesion could easily be endangered. Vaccinated people should be exempt from some restrictions, but let’s not go overboard. We need to move forward together and be patient until science tells us that it’s safe.
F2: This is a bit more on the cautious side, but overall, quite well received by many corners of society. Some, especially from within FDP and AfD, gripe about ongoing lockdowns - I guess you can’t always make everyone happy. This should definitely keep Covid under control though.
A3: It’s important that as many people as possible get vaccinated as quickly as possible so we can overcome this crisis. Maybe we should rethink the prioritization system we have right now.
F3: Some younger conservatives listen, but with the limited supply of vaccines available, there are not enough doses to vaccinate everyone who wants it. Questioning the prioritization system seems unfair to many older folks in your camp.
A4: The vaccine seems helpful now, but we haven’t had a chance to study its side effects yet. I advocate for a slowdown of the vaccination campaign until we have more information.
F4: This position places you far outside the mainstream - Drosten immediately goes on TV to criticize you, and many of your colleagues start to keep a certain distance from you. A certain part of the population calls you their hero, but they’re not a big electoral prize - prepare for a drop in the polls.

Q13: You have been invited to give a speech about German foreign and defence policy before some members of the Bundeswehr. What talking points do you want to emphasize?
A1: For years and years, we have consistently missed the NATO aim to spend 2% of our gross domestic product on defence. I strongly reaffirm our commitment to NATO and this goal! The West has to be united against potential threats.
F1: The audience cheers you on, as spending more on defence is always popular in more conservative circles, as is a commitment to the alliance. Not every potential voter is convinced of this, though - the anxiety of war runs deep in Germany’s collective memory.
A2: While I strongly reaffirm our support of a united Alliance and strong defense, I specifically want to call out Annalena Baerbock. She lacks a clear commitment to NATO, which is not appropriate for a chancellor.
F2: With how strong the Green Party has been in the polls lately, hitting on them seems like a good strategy. This is a usual attack against them, but even though they seem to move right on defense, it still seems to hit the spot after some of Baerbocks statements on the 2%-goal.
A3: Our defence policy is adequate as it is right now. While I want to strongly reaffirm my commitment to NATO, we don’t need to spend more on defence than we do right now, we need to combat waste first and foremost.
F3: This does little to differentiate you from other parties and is softer on defence than the usual position of your party. It does give you some minor wiggle room on fiscal and foreign policy - be sure to make use of it after the election.
A4: NATO is a relic of the cold war. We should stay a member for now, but we should also try to find avenues for cooperating with other nations, keep reaffirming our neutrality, and open up new dialogues with Russia or China.
F4: The crowd is silent, some cough in embarrassment. Maybe a few fringe voters will like this statement - everyone else is horrified, especially your party colleagues. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who got the position of Minister of Defence after her stint as party leader, openly disagrees with your statement.

Q14: June 2021: Things look to be on somewhat of an upswing. Baerbock is working herself through some scandals, and on top, the CDU was the big winner at the provincial elections in Saxony-Anhalt, with Minister-President Reiner Haseloff massively increasing the vote share of the CDU. How do you approach this situation?
A1: I want to congratulate Haseloff for his strong performance. It shows that the citizens still trust the CDU to be the best governing party, and we want to emulate his strategy on a national scale.
F1: While his performance was impressive, his strategy was partially built on his incumbency as a “Landesvater”. Still, it might not be a bad message to campaign on good governance. “For a Germany, in which we live well and gladly”, as Merkel advertised 4 years ago.
A2: Haseloff performed very well, but I want to emphasize that the AfD lost votes. When we keep appealing to all people, without prejudice, we can win them back for the democratic parties.
F2: The need to win back AfD voters is definitely something that most parties can agree on - hopefully, your focus on this front can actually yield electoral success. It’s unlikely they’ll exit the parliament, but maybe Haseloff has some good advice.
A3: This was a very strong performance. To show my gratitude, I will make an extra trip to Saxony-Anhalt and campaign with him for some nice pictures.
F3: Haseloff is glad to campaign with you. You definitely show your appreciation of Saxony-Anhalt, and East Germany notices. On your end, you enjoy some local </i> Rotkäppchen </i>and <i>Baumkuchen </i>as well as a visit to Martin Luther's hometown, the Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

Q15: Digitalization is an important topic in this election, with Germany often perceived as surprisingly archaic in comparison to its neighbours, frequently seen on the tail end of statistics. With all parties unveiling plans to rectify this, what focus do you want to lay?
A1: The pandemic has shown how ill-prepared our schools are. We need to continue improving digital infrastructure in education, through more training, technical assets or a national educational platform. That is what the CDU/CSU has worked on, and will continue doing.
F1: You’re right that this is important, and in line with the current government's strategy - but many blame your party for the current misery. Maybe it’s best not to focus on continuing the last 16 years here. Furthermore, some say these measures don’t go far enough, especially the FDP, who have staked out digitalization as their favourite topic.
A2: Actually, we don’t have much to gain by talking about this topic - many voters see us as responsible for the current situation. Let’s downplay it as much as we can and focus on issues where we are seen as more competent, like matters of security or debt.
F2: A fatalistic approach, but a reasonable one. Young voters are disappointed by your lack of a proper position, but better not to fan the flames lest you burn yourself, right?. Some Union officials are a bit peeved that you aren’t talking about their purported successes, but even they can read the numbers.
A3: We definitely need to modernize the digital infrastructure of Germany, especially in the public sector. Administrative matters have to be more accessible to citizens, we need to digitize all internal processes and cut down on bureaucracy.
F3: An expected answer, not a bad one - improving the accessibility of Germany’s famously sluggish bureaucracy is popular. However, most parties call for something like this, and this framing of your platform does not generate a lot of attention.
A4: Digitalization is a key issue - we need a digital transformation offensive. I want to especially emphasize that we will accomplish a nationwide 5G mobile network by 2025 and provide 15 billion Euro for Gigabit-networks. To that end, we will also establish a Ministry of Digital Innovation and Transformation.
F4: The 5G network is a strong promise that will especially help you in less urban areas, where even 4G coverage can be seen as luxurious in some corners. Your idea of a dedicated Ministry for this topic shows your dedication, but some criticize that digitalization is a cross-sectional task that shouldn't be centralized.

Q16: July 2021: Widespread flooding is affecting large areas of western, southern and middle Germany. The state you govern, North Rhine-Westphalia, is among the most affected. Do you have a first statement?
A1: The most important thing we can do right now is help the affected regions with their crisis management. They need help quickly and unbureaucratically.
F1: This response will help you in those areas, though some say that this is the least you can do.
A2: I want to praise local teams and local reactions. Some areas already had crisis teams ready when the sun was still shining and no one knew what would happen. I’m promising swift help for everyone affected.
F2: Many wonder why your own state government had no such crisis team despite weather warnings.
A3: First, we need to help the affected regions with the cleanup. After that, we have to guarantee financial emergency aid for affected people.
F3: Your own state government restricted emergency aid in such situations two years ago. This makes you seem opportunistic.
A4: Extreme weather events are unfortunately going to become more common due to climate change. This has shown us that we need to act decisively to now to keep global warming below 1.5°C.
F4: Explicitly connecting this to climate change might help the Green Party more than you.

Q17: Post-flood cleanup operations are going on as the full devastation of the flooding becomes clear. Many advisors urge you to get out and show yourself as a man of action.
A1: Actually, I don’t want to be seen as performative. I will keep coordinating the crisis efforts from the state chancellery.
F1: You are accused of being missing in action, but this might be safer.
A2: I want to get out there, yes, but let’s try to keep my visits below the radar so we don’t generate much media buzz.
F2: Being seen helps you locally, but without cameras, the nation is a bit confused about what you are doing.
A3: What a great idea! Let’s go visit some of the affected towns with German President Steinmeier.
F3: Oh no! A photo of you laughing during the visit is circulating in the media! People across the political spectrum criticize you for not taking the situation seriously.
A4: What a great idea! Let’s go visit some of the affected towns with German President Steinmeier.
F4: There are some tense moments and you have some awkward conversations. At least you get some neutral-to-positive media attention.

Q18: Climate change is a much-discussed topic again after the floodings. You have been asked to clarify your stance on how to best combat climate change.
A1: The floodings have shown that we need to be much more ambitious than before! For example, we need to stop using coal for energy generation by 2030.
F1: This is a very strong statement, and coal-producing regions are unhappy with this pivot. Still, this could win over some green voters.
A2: Climate change is coming, whether we want it or not. The most important thing we can do is mitigate its worst effects to prevent catastrophes like this from doing too much damage.
F2: You won’t win over Green voters like this, but your base is pleased.
A3: Let us not be impulsive here. Just because today is a day like this, you don't change politics. Our current climate legislation is sufficient.
F3: The statement is seen as tone-deaf by many.
A4: We need to do more to reduce our carbon emissions. Maybe we have to rethink the decision to exit nuclear energy before coal after recent events.
F4: This is a controversial topic with people on both sides of the argument. It doesn’t help that the decision to stop relying on nuclear energy was originally made by Merkel.

Q19: After early successes, the vaccination campaign has become sluggish in recent weeks. Some politicians are going so far as to demand making the vaccine mandatory.
A1: Compulsion is the wrong way to go about this. Instead, we need to convince people and continue our information campaign.
F1: Compulsory vaccination is unpopular, but this won’t help the vaccination campaign.
A2: While I wouldn’t go that far, we can give people more incentives to get vaccinated, like opening up things only for vaccinated and recovered people.
F2: This statement is received quite well overall and might make vaccinations more attractive. You might lose voters sceptical about vaccinations though.
A3: Covid is basically over, the case numbers are very low. I question if we need this expensive vaccination campaign at all.
F3: You win over some anti-Covid Querdenker. The rest of the country is deeply confused by this statement.
A4: I also think this is a good idea. We need to do everything we can to finally make Covid history.
F4: You’ve positioned yourself at the fringe of the conversation, compulsory vaccinations are generally unpopular.

Q20: August 2020: The SPD has been surging in the polls, drawing votes from both you and the Green Party. There are still many undecided voters too, though. Now it’s time to produce a video spot to advertise during the home stretch of this campaign and hopefully sway some people.
A1: Let’s incorporate some biographical elements, like that my father was a miner, and show how I closed the last mine in North Rhine-Westphalia. Then let’s talk about the importance of tackling climate change.
F1: Unfortunately, the video is widely mocked. Meanwhile, the SPD keeps surging.
A2: Covid is still on the minds of most people. Let’s focus on this and promise that I’m the one to bring normalcy back.
F2: The topic isn’t quite as important anymore as it was in the spring, and the vaccination campaign isn’t going all that great. Meanwhile, the SPD keeps surging.
A3: It’s best to play it safe. A spot about how I’m bringing different people together and how our country needs strong solidarity.
F3: The spot is somewhat well-received but unlikely to sway many voters. Meanwhile, the SPD keeps surging.
A4: I’ve been governing North Rhine-Westphalia successfully since 2017. I want to show my successes here and promise to bring them to Germany.
F4: You’re quite popular as Prime Minister. It helps to remind people of that. Meanwhile, the SPD still keeps surging.

Q21: It is basically guaranteed that there will be a coalition government after the elections. Which party would you be willing to govern with?
A1: We will talk with all democratic parties - the SPD, the Greens and the FDP. Unfortunately, not all parties will rule out coalition talks with the extremist Left party.
F1: This is your expected answer, but needling Scholz and Baerbock on their unclear statements towards the Left party plays well with your base.
A2: The grand coalition of the last 8 years is increasingly unpopular. We need to find a different governing majority.
F2: You’re right, though another grand coalition might be a good path to power for you, and this makes it a harder sell after the election.
A3: Actually, this new party spectrum needs new solutions. I think a Bahamas coalition with the AfD and the FDP could work.
F3: This goes against everything you and other CDU politicians have been saying. A coalition containing the AfD is poison to moderate voters, and both the SPD and the Green party rule out a coalition with you in turn. Meanwhile, the AfD is not enthusiastic to elect you, a moderate, chancellor.
A4: My favourite coalition would be black-yellow, like the one I’m leading in North Rhine-Westphalia now.
F4: It’s unlikely that black-yellow will have a majority, but one can dream.

Q22: Pictures of the disastrous retreat of NATO troops from Afghanistan go around the globe. The government is sharply criticised for its botched evacuation. What do you want to emphasize in this situation?
A1: This is the biggest debacle for NATO since its founding. We now have to analyse what went wrong and how we can avoid such situations in the future.
F1: Many see your analysis as correct, but wanted to hear more about what you wanted to do now.
A2: We need to take in more refugees from Afghanistan, especially people who cooperated with the German troops. We owe it to these people after they helped us!
F2: It’s unclear how you want to actually evacuate them, but the sentiment is appreciated. Some also fear the AfD could profit from a new wave of refugees.
A3: The foreign ministry under SPD control is clearly to blame for our part in this crisis. They should have started the evacuations much earlier.
F3: The SPD retorts by blaming the CDU-led defence ministry. This mudslinging is unproductive.
A4: We can’t have a repeat of the refugee crisis of 2015. We need to take it some refugees, yes, but avoid pictures like that at all costs.
F4: This keeps the AfD at bay, but is sharply criticized by more left-wing parties. Also, people don’t believe that you specifically are the right person for tough migration policies.

Q23: September 2021: For the first time in German history, there will be a three-way debate, a so-called “Triell”. You, Scholz of the SPD and Baerbock of the Green party are all invited. What do you want to focus on?
A1: Scholz has been surging a lot in the polls recently and I worry that he will not stop. It seems foolish to do anything but attack him.
F1: It seems right now like Scholz has become your main opponent, so this seems like a prudent choice.
A2: Baerbock has been struggling lately, but I’m still worried about the Green Party pulling away votes from us. Let’s focus on her.
F2: Her numbers keep slipping, but there might be an argument that there are voters to be won back from her.
A3: I will leave petty attacks to my opponents and focus more on policy. I’m certain the German people will appreciate hearing concrete solutions to their problems more than attacks.
F3: Let’s hope taking the high road helps you stand out!
A4: Actually, I don’t want two left-wing politicians to gang up on me. Let the two of them duke it out, I won’t attend this so-called Triell.
F4: Many question your judgment. This makes it look to people like the race is between Baerbock and Scholz.

Q24: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Olaf Scholz, vice chancellor and candidate of the SPD. What do you want to attack him on?
A1: He likes to present himself as a moderate, but he hasn’t completely ruled out a coalition with the extremist Left party. Can voters really trust him not to form this coalition after the election?
F1: Scholz is in a bit of an awkward spot with this attack and doesn’t give a clear answer. Overall, you and Baerbock tie the debate.
A2: Let’s hit him on his scandals as finance minister. Under his watch, Wirecard collapsed due to fraudulent dealings and lots of people lost their money. There was even a police raid on a government office belonging to his ministry.
F2: A damaging attack, but he and Baerbock hit back by mentioning corruption in your party like the mask dealings earlier this year. Baerbock is seen as the overall winner of the debate.
A3: The program of his party is very leftwing, especially regarding pensions and the minimum wage. It shows that the SPD as a whole is unfit to govern.
F3: You might have had an opening there, but the second part is an odd avenue of attack considering the CDU had a coalition government with the SPD for the past eight years. Scholz rebukes this rather easily and is seen as the winner of the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Scholz is seen as the winner of the debate.

Q25: During the Triell, you decided to focus on Annalena Baerbock, chancellor candidate of the Green party. What do you want to attack her on?
A1: She’s had some problems with plagiarism in a book she’s written and inflated her CV. These might seem like minor things, but can she really be trusted to govern this country?
F1: This is something she struggled with in the past, so the attack is quite damaging. Overall, you and Scholz tie the debate.
A2: Everyone on this stage agrees that something has to be done about climate change, but trying to forbid everything as Mrs Baerbock and her party want can’t be the solution!
F2: This devolves into a heated back and forth between the two of you with no clear winner. Scholz wins the debate.
A3: I’ll attack her for her willingness to govern with the radical Left party. This coalition is unpopular, moderates should be frightened by this prospect.
F3: Many Green voters aren’t against this potential coalition, so this attack isn’t all that effective. Overall, Scholz wins the debate.
A4: Actually, I’ve changed my mind. I’m just going to present myself as calm and above petty attacks.
F4: Since you haven’t prepared for this strategy, this doesn’t help you. Overall, Scholz wins the debate.

Q26: During the Triell, you decided to focus on presenting your case to the German people without too strong attacks. What are your main points?
A1: I want to present myself as the candidate having the best market-focused and realistic solutions for climate change. We are on a good path and don’t need more government intervention and bans on things.
F1: Baerbock criticises you sharply, and you are drawn into back-and-forths after all. Overall, Scholz wins the debate.
A2: With two left-leaning politicians debating with me, I will present myself as the voice of reason. For example, I have tax and social security plans that are actually affordable and generally promise sensible governance.
F2: This works, you convince voters worried about how Scholz and Baerbock want to pay for their proposals and potential tax hikes. You win the debate.
A3: I’m a known quantity and I’m the candidate who stands for a continuation of the Merkel years. With me, Germany will stay on a successful path.
F3: After 16 years of Merkel, the country is ready for a change, so this declaration isn’t all that popular. Overall, Scholz wins the debate.
A4: Actually, screw this! I will attack them both whenever an opportunity presents itself. That way, I can sharpen my profile and show myself as the most competent candidate.
F4: You come across as unprepared and overly aggressive. This doesn’t help you at all and overall, Scholz wins the debate.

Q27: Finally, this campaign is coming to an end. Do you have anyone, in particular, you want to campaign with during the last days before the election?
A1: It’s important that all wings of our party stay united and motivated to vote. Let’s campaign with Friedrich Merz to show that I’m taking people like him and his positions seriously.
F1: This will help you keep the right wing of your party in line. Good luck tonight!
A2: Who else but Angela Merkel could be the right person? She has won the last four elections, and I want to show people that I’m the one to continue her legacy.
F2: The outgoing chancellor herself is still very popular, so this should rally some voters.  Good luck tonight!
A3: I’m worried about the AfD taking first place in some East German states. I want to campaign there with local CDU politicians like Haselhof and Kretschmer.
F3: Hopefully this will keep the AfD in line.  Good luck tonight!
A4: Markus Söder and I didn’t always have the warmest relationship, but he is very popular in Bavaria. Let’s campaign with him there and show some unity between the CDU and CSU.
F4: He is definitely popular and happy to campaign with you in his home state. Good luck tonight!


(Q14
A4: While the results in Saxony-Anhalt are definitely praiseworthy, I want to focus on Baerbocks scandals. She has not been honest about her CV and has shamelessly plagiarized in her book. She shows serious concerns about her integrity that have to be called out.
F4: You’re right of course, and you do keep the attention on Baerbocks scandals. That said, you also push voters away from your own successes, and during all the sniping and back-and-forths, Olaf Scholz is recently seen more often with his signature “smurfy grin”.)
