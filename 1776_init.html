In real history, here's what happened to these great men and women of the Revolution after this chapter...</i></p><ul><li><b>John Adams</b>: Our story’s most crucial character was unbreakable in his determination to serve the country he had helped foster.  Following the Lee Resolve’s passage, Adams was shipped to the court of Versailles, where he struggled to fit in with the Frenchmen.  After the war’s end he was made America’s ambassador to the Court of St. James in London, where he was more successful.  Around this time he sent his firstborn son, John Quincy to be apprenticed in diplomacy in St. Petersburg.  He returned to America a hero as the Constitution—largely inspired by his Thoughts on Government—was being ratified.  In 1788, he was presented by New England men as a potential candidate for the first president.  The New England electors were emphatic in their support for Adams, and he received the second most votes (because electors at the time were afforded two equal votes, their other votes for Washington made the general’s election unanimous).  As such, Adams became the nascent country’s first Vice President, a post he loathed.  In 1796, following Washington’s two terms, Adams was elected president.  Adams was deathly determined to keep America neutral from Europe’s wars, and rejected imperialistic calls by other Federalists, including party leader Alexander Hamilton.  He infamously signed the Alien and Sedition Acts at the behest of the Federalists, limiting free speech.  He lost the 1800 election against his friend-turned-rival, Thomas Jefferson.  After the death of Abigail Adams in 1818, Jefferson and Adams reconnected in retirement, and their correspondence would prove the most enduring friendship of American history.  Adams died on July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</li><li><b>Abigail Adams</b>: John’s wife, Abigail would remain his most faithful friend for the rest of her life, before dying in 1818.  She is remembered by some as the “Founding Mother” for her influence on her husband’s thinking and actions, and she is memorialized as one of the country’s most fondly remembered and intelligent first ladies.</li><li><b>George Washington</b>: The commanding leader of the Continental Army, George Washington was immensely famous following his victory in the Revolutionary War, and was later elected the first president.</li><li><b>Isaac Senter</b>: In real life, the surgeon who saved Benedict Arnold’s life would, after the war, become an eminent surgeon in Pawtucket, and an honorary member of medical societies throughout the world.</li><li><b>Benedict Arnold</b>: Benedict Arnold continued to serve with distinction even after the failed invasion of Quebec, and his being saved by Dr. Senter.  Consistently passed up for promotions and his accomplishments diminished in the eyes of the nation, Benedict Arnold married into a Tory family and fled to British lines in 1780.  He lived the rest of his life in England and Canada.</li><li><b>Thomas Paine</b>: The most insistent revolutionary of our story became increasingly radical as the years progressed.  He took part in the French Revolution and was elected to their National Convention.  His ideas remain controversial, but it’s hard to argue that the man wasn't ahead of his era.</li><li><b>John Dickinson</b>: After his conciliatory measures were finally and firmly defeated by the passage of the Declaration and his government in Pennsylvania simultaneously toppled, Dickinson enlisted in the Army and served the new American country with distinction.  If he is remembered, it is as a good man unfortunately on the wrong side of history.</li><li><b>Thomas Jefferson</b>: The Declaration of Independence was originally an afterthought, but brought to life by the prose and style of its genius author Thomas Jefferson.  Jefferson’s prestige was made on the back of his proclamation.  After the Revolution, Jefferson would also help author the French Revolution’s Declaration of the Rights of Man.  He was Secretary of State, second Vice President and third President.  He also dabbled in architecture, invention, academics and countless other pursuits.</li><li><b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Benjamin Franklin was a brilliant scientist, physicist and stateman, and this story hardly highlighted in full the enormity of his esteem.  After the Declaration was passed, he was essential in winning French support for the new republic, and in the drafting of the Constitution</li><li><b>James Duane</b>: Duane eventually broke and supported the Declaration, but abstained in line with his state’s instruction.  He later served as mayor of New York City.</li><li><b>James Wilson</b>: The Pennsylvanian who delivered the “inclemencies” parable, James Wilson later played a very strong role in the formation of the Constitution, specifically in regards to the executive branch.</li><li><b>Richard Henry Lee</b>: Richard Henry Lee later served as president of the Continental Congress, and as senator from Virginia following the passage of the Constitution.</li><li><b>Samuel Adams</b>: After the events of Philadelphia, John’s cousin Samuel would retire from the Congress in 1781.  He would have a modest political career following the Revolution, notably being governor of Massachusetts.  Despite being a popular name of American cultural mythology, Samuel Adams’ role in the Revolution is not well-taught or understood among the general American public.  The coup he orchestrated in Philadelphia is not well-known beyond academia.  Certain historians have criticized Adams’ populism and violent rhetoric</li></ul><br><br><br><br><p><b><h2>Author’s Note</h2></b></p><p><i>❝Such well-worn trappings, the show buckles and snuff, the galloping scenery and ‘theater’ of revolutionary days, have become stale to the point of spuriousness, they only obscure the human beings they are supposed to clothe.  They are props, short cuts — and there is no short cut to historic realization.  To make the acquaintance of a period is a slow and concentrated exercise; it cannot be hurried any more than prayer can be hurried.  Such procedure is our only antidote against the flood of pompous ancestral rhetoric, the stately thick brocaded curtain two centuries have drawn between us and our subject.❞</i></p><p>— Catherine Drinker Bowen, John Adams, 1950</p><p>This quote, from the introduction to Catherine Drinker Bowen’s novelesque biography of John Adams was deeply inspiring to me in the creation of this modification.  It reminded me that there are stories we tell ourselves, but that the true stories of history are hardly so clearcut.  In 1817, years after John Adams lost political relevancy and was rendered a name on a scroll more than a living, breathing person, he could see then the first formations of this cult of historical revision.  He confidently declared, “I consider the true history of the American revolution lost forever.”</p><p>He was hardly wrong.  Most Americans who consider themselves to have an understanding of the Revolution can tell you about the Boston Massacre, the Shot Heard Round the World, the heroic comeback at Trenton, and the victory at Yorktown.  They can tell you about the courage of General Washington and his troops.  They can tell you about the idealistic visions of men like Jefferson and Paine.  They have a painting, engraved deeply in their patriotic imagination, of the thirteen colonies coming together, cutting down the British subjugators and confidently taking their place in the field of nations.</p><p>This version of history is only half-true, and a 50% grade isn’t passing.  Those Americans have no serious understanding of the history of their country’s most early formation.  American independence was not with won by the magics of patriotism.  It was won in Congress by a group of bold, political risktakers who declared independence by a series of extreme measures and compromises.  It was rough, coordinated, and lucky.  Our independence was not conjured, it was carved out.</p><p><b>It was my chief prerogative with this mod firstly to understand the true history, and then to tell it.  This was the creation and passage of the Lee Resolution and the Declaration of Independence as it truly was, or at least as close to gripping that lost history Adams described as possible.</b><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>This mod was written by Tom1923.</p><br><p>This mod was coded by OfficialAiden.</p><br><p>This mod was playtested by Intenew, Stockdale, ItsAstronomical, Slordoo, cupofcoffee6435, TedThing and Kaiserlink.</p><br><p>This mod’s map was created by TomBox.</p><br><p>This mod was devoted to our players, who make modding worthwhile.</p><br><a href='https://discord.com/invite/bRGXDEW2QN'> Join the Red Mod Series Discord Server!</a></div><br><br>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"https://i.imgur.com/7QbYUZp.png\"}}]");
